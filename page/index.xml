      <description>I am a passionate software developer currently working as a Senior Software Engineer at Braintree in San Francisco.
I started my career building integration for Mingle - ThoughtWork&amp;rsquo;s project management / collaboration tool. I went on to become a senior developer on Twist where we pushed the boundaries of what a functional testing tool could do.
Later, I moved to San Francisco to help migrate Mingle from an on-premise model to a SaaS offering on Amazon AWS technologies.</description>
