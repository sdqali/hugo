            <p><em>Njaan Varaam, Assalamu Alaikum</em> (I will be back, Peace Be Upon You). I felt myself choking as those words escaped my mouth. And as I reached the gate and took my first step out, I heard my mother say <em>Wa Alaikum Assalaam</em> (Peace Be Upon You, too). And then I felt the straps of the laptop bag sink into my shoulders, and it felt so heavy. It should not be. It still had the same stuff as it did when I set on my journey home on the Friday evening. In fact, it should feel lighter, as I had moved some stuff into another bag, which I was holding in my right hand. Sigh! I knew why I choked and the bag felt heavier.</p>

<p>I had been performing this almost teary-eyed, choking Good Bye scene endless number of times, ever since I was 12. The first, if I remember correctly, was when I set on my journey to be part of the residential school which would end up as my world for the subsequent seven years. I remember being sad, and being happy and excited with anticipation at living at the school. My good bye was not drenched in tears, nor were I choking.</p>

<p>The choking and the tears happened when I was about to return to the school after my first trip back home. I had seen the school, experienced it and quickly had realized that it was not what I wanted. But, I went back, and ever since saying Good Bye to my mother at the gate is an experience that makes me deeply emotional. Even these days, when I know that going back home is as easy as jumping onto a bus. But still, somewhere deep inside me, I can still hear that boy telling me &lsquo;Dude, you wont be back till the next vacation, and you know what? The next vacation is in next May. That is five months!&rsquo;. Those of you who know about my school would understand the significance of those words. For others, <a href="/blog/2008/11/12/school-story-the-adult-magazines-and-the-great-raid/">this</a> would give some idea.</p>

<p>Post school, I went to college at Trivandrum. During the first year, I used to find silly excuses to come home almost every other weekend. I didn&rsquo;t mind bunking classes, just to go home. And after all these trips, I still lived those moments of choking, all over again. I knew, I could be back here the next day, if I wanted to. I knew I was no longer in a &lsquo;jail&rsquo;. Still, it hurt.</p>

<p>These days, when I know that nothing would prevent me from getting back home the next weekend, I still feel that choking. I am too old to cry, but it would be a lie if I said that there were no tears lingering in the depths of my eyes. You see, however silly it might seem,for me, saying Good Bye is a big deal and it hurts.</p>
