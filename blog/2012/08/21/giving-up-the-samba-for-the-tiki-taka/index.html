<meta name="twitter:description" content="A shot flew over the bar. The goal keeper showed great urgency in
collecting the ball from behind the goal. Instead of kicking it forward, he pushed the ball
gently out to the centre back. As the opposition forward streamed
forward to close him down, the defender moved the ball swiftly and pushed it to
the right back who was level with the penalty box. Another push and the
central mid fielder was brought in to the play. A through ball to the
left found the player on the left wing and as the opposing
right back zoomed in to focus, he played it back to his left back. As
the left back controlled the ball, his
team repositioned themselves to start from scratch all over again. To build
from the back.

If you have watched football in the recent past, you would recognise a
pattern here. You would see the unmistakable Barcelona blueprint. Except
that I am not describing Barcelona. Not even Spain. In fact when the
initial shot flew over the bar, there was no collective sigh of relief
from a crowd [packed till the heavens](&ldquo;http://mkbarcelona.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/200311-005.jpg&quot;),
there was no eager ball boy to throw the ball back at the keeper and
there was no one in the dug out shouting instructions at the
players. Hell, there was not even a dug out near the touch line. The
keeper ran to the construction site where the ball had found it&rsquo;s way
through and ran back all the way to get the play restarted. As he was
still was running back, the left back of my opponents walked back to his
position, his face embellished with a smile bore out of his pride
of having bent his shot around the cashew tree inside the
ground.

      <p>A shot flew over the bar. The goal keeper showed great urgency in
collecting the ball from behind the goal. Instead of kicking it forward, he pushed the ball
gently out to the centre back. As the opposition forward streamed
forward to close him down, the defender moved the ball swiftly and pushed it to
the right back who was level with the penalty box. Another push and the
central mid fielder was brought in to the play. A through ball to the

the left back controlled the ball, his
team repositioned themselves to start from scratch all over again. To build
from the back.</p>

<p>If you have watched football in the recent past, you would recognise a
pattern here. You would see the unmistakable Barcelona blueprint. Except
that I am not describing Barcelona. Not even Spain. In fact when the
initial shot flew over the bar, there was no collective sigh of relief
from a crowd [packed till the heavens](&ldquo;<a href="http://mkbarcelona.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/200311-005.jpg&quot;">http://mkbarcelona.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/200311-005.jpg&quot;</a>),
there was no eager ball boy to throw the ball back at the keeper and
there was no one in the dug out shouting instructions at the
players. Hell, there was not even a dug out near the touch line. The
keeper ran to the construction site where the ball had found it&rsquo;s way
through and ran back all the way to get the play restarted. As he was
still was running back, the left back of my opponents walked back to his
position, his face embellished with a smile bore out of his pride
of having bent his shot around the cashew tree inside the
ground.</p>

<p>This place is home. As I run back to my own position of a centre back, I realize
that my heart is beginning to swell with pride and my mind with perspective.</p>

<p>I have come home to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kottakkal">Kottakkal</a> to celebrate Eid-ul-Fitr and find myself in the
middle of this engrossing contest. I grew up here and know almost all
these lads since I was a kid. The change in their playing style and more
importantly what they appreciate and look for in a player is astronomic.</p>

<p>Kottakkal is in Malappuram, one of the handful of football crazy islands
in a sea of Cricket named India. I am immensely proud of the fact that I
was born and raised here and learned to play football here.</p>

<p><img src="/images/football_flags.jpg" alt="Flags" />
</p>

<p>Malappuram loves football and that is a proper understatement. Makeshift
stadiums on paddy fields attract 10k+ crowd during the hot
summer. People attend weddings wearing their football team shirts. Being
able to play football well is a matter of pride and local enterprises
spend a lot of money to sponsor local tournaments and local teams. There
are people who have never flown a flag of India, but who decorates the
streets with their favourite football team&rsquo;s flags. Family connections
are forgotten and friendships are forged based on what teams people
support. 12 foot cut-outs of players adorn streets when major
tournaments are around the corner. Elderly men discuss the role of a
withdrawn forward while sipping glasses of tea in tea shops.</p>

<p><img src="/images/poster_portugal.jpg" alt="Portugal" />
</p>

<p>People of Malappuram madly love Brazil. While there is a significant
minority that subscribes to the other Latin American school of football
hailing from Argentina
and there does exist pockets that adore the Italians, the Germans, the
Portuguese and the English, Brazil is king. The fans of Brazil in
Malappuram are large in number, immensely proud and deafeningly
vocal. The Brazilian way of playing is revered and kids copy moves and
fashion their game around Brazilian legends.</p>

<p><img src="/images/poster_brazil.jpg" alt="Brazil" />
</p>

<p>But one can not escape the growing feeling that things are
changing. While it would be ridiculous to even suggest that Brazil&rsquo;s fan
base in Malappuram is eroding, people are moving away from the
Brazilian style. Announcements through the tannoy for tournaments
mention tiki-taka more than they mention the samba, the wee lad on the
left who threads in delicious through balls forward would rather be
called <em>Iniesta</em> than <em>Kaka</em> and when you are leading the game, you
openly announce that your team is going to perform <em>tiki-taka</em> till the
opposition catches up.</p>

<p>This change in style has been brought up by two independent events. As
you guessed correctly, the first is the astronomical rise of the
all conquering, beautiful Barcelona way. The second, and less obvious
factor is the abandonment of the Brazilian way by none other than the
likes of Brazil&rsquo;s former coach Dunga.</p>

<p>Brazil of the yesteryears were pleasing on the eye and effective. This added
with the opportunities to watch the best of Brazilian talent strut it
out in Europe made the powerful style the accepted style in Malappuram.</p>

<p>Dunga&rsquo;s Brazil played a brand of football that was effective, but not
necessarily pleasing on the eye. He deployed two screening midfielders
in front of the back four and sought to control the game rather than go
out and go for the neck. There are arguments, no less from the
<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2012/aug/14/olympics-exposed-flaw-brazilian-football">great Jonathan Wilson</a>
that Brazil had been playing with this safety first approach for a long
time now. However under Dunga, Brazil played with a level of pragmatism
that had not been seen from them before. This is symbolised by Dunga&rsquo;s
use of Felipe Melo a tenacious, hard tackling, no nonsense defensive
midfielder. Melo and Brazil beat most of the teams that came across
their path and went on to win the Copa America. Brazil started grinding
out results, although it has to be said that their graft looked more
beautiful than watching some of the lesser teams like England trying to
grind out a result. Brazil were no longer exciting to watch. This would
go on till Dunga&rsquo;s departure after a Dutch team who were more organised
than them and showed more desire knocked them out of the World Cup in
2010. Incidentally, Felipe Melo was sent off in that match.</p>

<p>Meanwhile in Catalonia, a master named Pepe Guardiola had assembled a
team that was mighty effective, beautiful and had the neutrals purring
with admiration. Barcelona was in vogue and the definition of beautiful
football in Malappuram changed gradually from Brazilian flair to the
measured, controlled infusion of the right amount of passing, pressing
and possession. Through balls, or &ldquo;passing the ball to space&rdquo; as Xavi
Hernandez <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2011/feb/11/xavi-barcelona-spain-interview">would have you believe</a> became more valuable than step
overs. People demanded passes from goalkeepers instead of a kick
forward. Brazil fans started grudgingly accepting the fact that the
Barcelona way was beautiful. The effectiveness of the Barcelona way was
something you could not doubt, evidenced by their steam rolling of
everyone in sight. On the other hand, effectiveness of the Dunga way was
questionable after the World Cup exit.</p>

<p>While there is a quantum shift in playing style and appreciation, Brazil
is still the most popular team. Despite their love for the Barcelona
way, fans of Brazil continue to be fans of Brazil. Kids go out to the
paddy fields and laterite rockbeds and play in the Bercelona way but when they
 come back, they huddle in front of TVs and cheer for Brazil. After all, if there is one
thing worse than inglorious performances from one&rsquo;s team for a football
fan, it is the shame of having to switch allegiances.</p>
