      configuring our Jenkins instance. This was the first time I had
      played around with Jenkins. I am fairly comfortable
      with Go from ThoughtWorks Studios. All of
      my past teams used Go as their tool for continuous
      delivery.One of the things I found very different from
      Go in Jenkins is the absence of the notion of a Pipeline as the

      Jenkins&rsquo; model of Jobs.Another difference I spotted is
      that when a custom task is defined as part of a Job, Jenkins
      creates a shell script with all the steps while executing the
      Job. In Go, each of the steps will have to be defined as a custom
      command.We wanted to ensure that our Jenkins
      configuration is version controlled. While this is a huge win, one
      of the ways this situation deteriorates is when a large number of
      changes are made to the configuration over a period of time and
      these is not checked in. So we decided to take this one step
      further and ensure that these changes are automatically checked
      in. There are instructions on how to do this, but we had to do
      some tweaking to get this working for us.

These are the steps to setup a bullet proof Jenkins setup. This assumes that Jenkins is running on a Linux box.<br /><br />1. Create a Git repository in Jenkins' base directory - This is generally <i>/var/lib/jenkins</i><br />2.&nbsp;Create a&nbsp;<i>.gitignore</i>&nbsp;file to exclude Jenkins workspaces.&nbsp;The Jenkins base directory is the home directory for the Jenkins user created to run Jenkins. This means that there will be a number of&nbsp;Linux user specific files like&nbsp;<i>.ssh/ , .gem</i>&nbsp;etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These files need to be specified in the .gitignore file. A sample .gitignore file is listed below.<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/1732836.js?file=.gitignore"></script><br />3. Setup a Jenkins job to check in the changed configuration files every day at midnight. (Or whatever time interval you choose). Add a custom task with the following steps:<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/1732873.js?file=gistfile1.sh"></script><br />While this ensures that the configuration is more or less tracked well, there are times when somebody makes a massive change in the configuration. This is where the most important piece of the bullet proof configuration comes in - team discipline. The team should ensure that big changes are checked in as soon add possible. This can be easily done by triggering the Jenkins job manually, without having to ssh in to the Jenkins box.<br /><br /><b>Credits:</b><br />1.  The Jenkins community documentation provided a nice <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/content/keeping-your-configuration-and-data-subversion" target="_blank">starting point</a> for this.<br />2.  The .gitignore file was forked from <a href="https://gist.github.com/780105" target="_blank">this gist</a> by <a href="https://github.com/sit" target="_blank"><span id="goog_1138400375"></span>sit</a>. I have added some project specific stuff to it.</div></div></div></div>
