These are the steps to setup a bullet proof Jenkins setup. This assumes that Jenkins is running on a Linux box.<br /><br />1. Create a Git repository in Jenkins' base directory - This is generally <i>/var/lib/jenkins</i><br />2.&nbsp;Create a&nbsp;<i>.gitignore</i>&nbsp;file to exclude Jenkins workspaces.&nbsp;The Jenkins base directory is the home directory for the Jenkins user created to run Jenkins. This means that there will be a number of&nbsp;Linux user specific files like&nbsp;<i>.ssh/ , .gem</i>&nbsp;etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These files need to be specified in the .gitignore file. A sample .gitignore file is listed below.<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/1732836.js?file=.gitignore"></script><br />3. Setup a Jenkins job to check in the changed configuration files every day at midnight. (Or whatever time interval you choose). Add a custom task with the following steps:<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/1732873.js?file=gistfile1.sh"></script><br />While this ensures that the configuration is more or less tracked well, there are times when somebody makes a massive change in the configuration. This is where the most important piece of the bullet proof configuration comes in - team discipline. The team should ensure that big changes are checked in as soon add possible. This can be easily done by triggering the Jenkins job manually, without having to ssh in to the Jenkins box.<br /><br /><b>Credits:</b><br />1.  The Jenkins community documentation provided a nice <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/content/keeping-your-configuration-and-data-subversion" target="_blank">starting point</a> for this.<br />2.  The .gitignore file was forked from <a href="https://gist.github.com/780105" target="_blank">this gist</a> by <a href="https://github.com/sit" target="_blank"><span id="goog_1138400375"></span>sit</a>. I have added some project specific stuff to it.</div></div></div></div>
