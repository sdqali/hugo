Consider the following snippet:

print &quot;some text in single line&quot;

print &quot;&quot;&quot;
As opposed to
some text
written as
heredoc
&quot;&quot;&quot;
print &quot;and then another single line&quot;


When run, this would result in this:

bash-3.2$ python test.py
some text in single line

As opposed to
some text
written as
heredoc

and then another single line


Notice how there is a preceding and trailing linebreak around the string printed using heredoc.

<p>I have been doing some coding in Python recently. While playing around with some code, I noticed that the way <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_document">heredocs</a> are used in Python is different from Ruby.</p>

<h2 id="python:1862f2fee684b3ca532b180bcd0276b6">Python</h2>

<p>Consider the following snippet:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python"># test.py

print &quot;some text in single line&quot;

print &quot;&quot;&quot;
As opposed to
some text
written as
heredoc
&quot;&quot;&quot;
print &quot;and then another single line&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>When run, this would result in this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">bash-3.2$ python test.py
some text in single line

As opposed to
some text
written as
heredoc

and then another single line
</code></pre>

<p>Notice how there is a preceding and trailing linebreak around the string printed using heredoc.</p>

<p>I spent a lot of time trying to figure out how and why this was happening. Finally, help came from <code>@dibb</code> on <code>#python</code>. Looks like I was doing it wrong. In Python, the useful part of the heredoc starts immediately after the <code>&quot;&quot;&quot;</code>. So if you don&rsquo;t want those excess linebreaks, you should write something like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python"># test2.py

print &quot;some text in single line&quot;

print &quot;&quot;&quot;As opposed to
some text
written as
heredoc&quot;&quot;&quot;

print &quot;and then another single line&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>When run, this would print the text without the extra line breaks:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">bash-3.2$ python test2.py
some text in single line
As opposed to
some text
written as
heredoc
and then another single line
</code></pre>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t want to write the string just after the <code>&quot;&quot;&quot;</code>, you could use a <code>\</code> to remove the linebreaks, like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python"># test3.py

print &quot;&quot;&quot;\
As opposed to
some text
written as
heredoc\
&quot;&quot;&quot;
</code></pre>

<h2 id="ruby:1862f2fee684b3ca532b180bcd0276b6">Ruby</h2>

<p>I come from the Ruby world, where the heredocs behave in a slightly different way. The equivalent code in Ruby would look like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby"># test.rb

puts &quot;some text in single line&quot;

puts &lt;&lt;-STR
As opposed to
some text
written as
heredoc
STR

puts &quot;and then another single line&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>Notice how the actual content of the heredoc begins only on the line after <code>&lt;&lt;-STR</code></p>

<p>I hope being aware of this detail saves you some time.</p>
