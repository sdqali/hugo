  <h1>First week in San Francisco</h1>
  <span class="post-date">Mon, Jan 21, 2013</span>
      

<p>I moved to San Francisco last week and is just getting acquainted with
the city. This blog
post is a summary of my first impressions of SF to share with a lot of friends whom I have not been able to keep in touch and who have been wondering what I am up to.</p>

<h1 id="it-is-cold-here:a8a8598654b1b81e579803a4570d31e5">It is cold here</h1>

<p>I landed in SF without enough winter wear. I had a windbreaker that I
used in Bangalore and provided more than adequate warmth back in
Bangalore. Soon, I realised that it won&rsquo;t be enough. Temperatures were
under 10 C. I had to get a proper jacket.</p>

<h1 id="the-views-are-stunning:a8a8598654b1b81e579803a4570d31e5">The views are stunning</h1>

<p>Pretty much wherever you are in the city, you have nice views - the bay,
the Golden Gate bridge or the downtown. As a bonus, the place where
ThoughtWorks put me up has nice views of the bay.</p>

<h1 id="vehicles-actually-stop-for-pedestrians:a8a8598654b1b81e579803a4570d31e5">Vehicles actually stop for pedestrians</h1>

<p>Walking to work on Bangalore&rsquo;s roads was a tough experience because
nobody waited for the pedestrians to cross and the red signals were
eaten away by bikers eager to squeeze in. Walking on SF&rsquo;s streets is a
pleasant experience. Sidewalks are wide and clean and when you have to
cross the road, vehicles actually stop and let you pass.</p>

<h1 id="diversity:a8a8598654b1b81e579803a4570d31e5">Diversity</h1>

<p>SF is a place with huge racial, religious and cultural diversity. There
is something for everyone here. From the busy people in the Financial
District to the guy selling weed at the Fisherman&rsquo;s wharf to the people
roaming the market street, SF has a lot of variety.</p>

<h1 id="the-golden-gate-bridge-is-magnificent:a8a8598654b1b81e579803a4570d31e5">The Golden Gate bridge is magnificent</h1>

<p>It looks stunning in the pictures. It looks even better when you see it
up close.</p>
