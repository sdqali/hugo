            <p>The past few days have just flown by. I had to learn so much things and did not have much time to do it. Most days, I sleep around 2:00 in the morning.</p>

<p>When I was in college, I had friends who were already working. I used to wonder why sometimes they did not reply to a mail I sent, or did not ping me back when I pinged them on IM. Well, now I know! If any of you are reading this, guys, please pardon me for not understanding.</p>

<p>I had an assignment to submit and I got the feedback that the work I had done was &lsquo;Poor&rsquo;. Had a tough time, when I got the response. But having thought about the feedback given to me about the assignment, I now understand that there are a lot of thins I need to learn, there are changes to be made in the way I approach coding, and there are some stuff to be un-learned.</p>

<p>I hope I will be able to cope with the pressure and move forward.</p>
