## 1. Install Docker

### Linux

- Install Docker Community Edition for your Linux distro based on instructions available at the official [installation page](https://docs.docker.com/install/#supported-platforms).
- Ensure that you can run Docker as a non-root user. Instructions for this are available [here](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user).
- Test your set up by running the command `docker run hello-world`.

### MacOS

- Install Docker Desktop for MacOS using instruction available [here](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/).
- Test your set up by running the command `docker run hello-world`.

### Windows

- Install Docker Desktop for Windows, following instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/).
- Test your set up by running the command `docker run hello-world`.

## 2. Install a code editor

- If you are the sort of person with a favorite editor, it should suffice.
- For everyone else, [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a decent editor that won't hold you back.
