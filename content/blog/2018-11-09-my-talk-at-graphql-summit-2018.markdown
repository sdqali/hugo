I had the opportunity to give a talk at [GraphQL Summit 2018](https://summit.graphql.com/) about the experience of introducing GraphQL for our [Payments API](https://graphql.braintreepayments.com/) at [Braintree](https://www.braintreepayments.com/). It was well received, as far as I could tell - I received a lot of nice feedback and had great conversations with members of the community.

The slides are available here on [SpeakerDeck](https://speakerdeck.com/sdqali/graphql-for-a-payments-api). I will update this post with links to the video of my talk when it becomes available.
