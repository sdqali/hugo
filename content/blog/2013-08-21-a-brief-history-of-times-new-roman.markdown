title: A brief History of Times New Roman
---

Mathew Butterick's Practical Typography [^1] features a section dedicated to the History of Times New Roman [^2]. It is an interesting read.

> Why not? Fame has a dark side. When Times New Roman appears in a book, document, or advertisement, it connotes apathy. It says, “I submitted to the font of least resistance.” Times New Roman is not a font choice so much as the absence of a font choice, like the blackness of deep space is not a colour. To look at Times New Roman is to gaze into the void.
