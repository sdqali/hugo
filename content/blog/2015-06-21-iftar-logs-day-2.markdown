<!--more-->

Ramadan started yesterday for me, right on time as I have an opportunity to cook again, having moved to an apartment from the hotel where I have been staying for the large part of last year. I could not document yesterday's Iftar as it was rushed and at a restaurant on my way back from the airport after my flight to San Francisco had been canceled. So this series starts with Day 2.

Clockwise from bottom:

* Chapli Kebab
* Store-bought Coconut Milk drink
* Water melon and pine apple
* Berries and cantaloupe
* Water
* Lemonade
