<div><div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">I recently did a talk on football and the politics behind it, as part of the Banyan Tree talk series at ThoughtWorks. The slides from the talk can be found <a href="http://speakerdeck.com/u/sdqali/p/football-as-a-lense">here</a> on Speakerdeck.<br /><br /></div>It was great fun for me. I thought I did well. It is a topic I know my way around. The history behind the El Clasico - the Spanish civil war, Franco, the trade unions and Di Stefano was discussed. We also looked at The Old Firm. I also talked about Athletic Bilbao's use of football as a form of cultural resistance. The last parts of the talk were about multiculturalism, united Europe and football as a globalized game.<br /><br />&nbsp;About 20 people turned up and while most of them liked it, some had the opinion that they needed to understand more European history to fully appreciate it.</div></div></div>
