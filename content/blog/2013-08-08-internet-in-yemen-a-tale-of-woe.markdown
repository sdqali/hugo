Haykal Bafana paints a [sad picture](http://blog.haykal.sg/index.php/yemen1/20-ec/20-internet-in-yemen-a-tale-of-woe) of the state of internet access in Yemen.

> Each time a saboteur cuts the fiber optic lines in Marib, Internet access in Sanaa and even eastern Yemeni regions such as Hadhramaut are affected severely. Many have asked me before : why should a sparsely populated desert area like Marib be so critical to Yemen's Internet service? A detour into the murky history of Yemeni telecommunications is necessary.

Despite some of the world's most important undersea cable networks [^1] passing through Yemen's maritime borders and one of them having two landing points [^2] inside Yemen, the country's sole internet provider buys internet from Saudi Arabia's STC.

It is a fascinating story about the confluence of politics, corruption and technology.

[Greg's Cablemap](http://www.cablemap.info/) provides an interactive map of the under sea cable system.
