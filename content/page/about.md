I am a passionate software developer currently working as a Senior Consultant at ThoughtWorks.
<br/>
<br/>
I started my career building integration for [Mingle](https://www.thoughtworks.com/mingle/) - ThoughtWork's project management / collaboration tool. I went on to become a senior developer on [Twist](https://www.thoughtworks.com/products/twist-agile-testing) where we pushed the boundaries of what a functional testing tool could do.
<br/>
<br/>
Later, I moved to San Francisco to help migrate Mingle from an on-premise model to a SaaS offering on Amazon AWS technologies.
<br/>
<br/>
For the past 2.5 years, I have been helping ThoughtWork's partners and clients solve challenging technological problems - from Content Management Systems to E-commerce micro-services to in store grocery picking solutions to money Movement systems to banking portals, I have used a broad range of diverse tools to help clients build high value software systems.
<br/>
<br/>
This blog is a place for me to share the working, tested solutions to various problems and challenges I have found along the way.
