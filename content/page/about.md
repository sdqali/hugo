I am a passionate software developer currently working as a Senior Software Engineer at [Braintree](https://www.braintreepayments.com/) in San Francisco.

I started my career building integration for [Mingle](https://www.thoughtworks.com/mingle/) - ThoughtWork's project management / collaboration tool. I went on to become a senior developer on [Twist](https://www.thoughtworks.com/products/twist-agile-testing) where we pushed the boundaries of what a functional testing tool could do.

Later, I moved to San Francisco to help migrate Mingle from an on-premise model to a SaaS offering on Amazon AWS technologies.

I spent the next 3.5 years helping ThoughtWork's partners and clients solve challenging technological problems - from Content Management Systems to E-commerce Microservices to in-store grocery picking solutions to Payment and Disbursement systems to Banking Portals, I have used a broad range of diverse tools to help clients build high value software systems.

This blog is a place for me to share the working, tested solutions to various problems and challenges I have found along the way.
