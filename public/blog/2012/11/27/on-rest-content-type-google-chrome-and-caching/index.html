REST puts a lot of emphasis on resources, their representations and states. Basically a URL indicates a
single resource; the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) indicates what
action should be performed on that resource; and the ACCEPT header indicates the format that the resource should be presented in.

Chrome and Content-Type

Having seen this, one would assume that if you have a resource, say a
User on your system and there were two representations of that
resource - HTML and JSON. Let&rsquo;s assume that the HTML representation does
an AJAX call to fetch the JSON representation and renders it. While this
sounds simple enough, Google Chrome, one of the world&rsquo;s most popular
browsers
totally breaks this. A
good example of this weird behaviour can be seen here.

<p>Representational State Transfer (REST) is a style of software
architecture for distributed systems that has replaced technologies like
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP">SOAP</a> as the predominant Web service
design model. Originally proposed by Roy Fielding in his <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm">Doctorate
dissertation</a>,
REST puts a lot of emphasis on resources, their representations and states. Basically a URL indicates a
single resource; the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) indicates what
action should be performed on that resource; and the ACCEPT header indicates the format that the resource should be presented in.</p>

<h2 id="chrome-and-content-type:81ded0c677aedede844b66006f9428ca">Chrome and Content-Type</h2>

<p>Having seen this, one would assume that if you have a resource, say a
<code>User</code> on your system and there were two representations of that
resource - HTML and JSON. Let&rsquo;s assume that the HTML representation does
an AJAX call to fetch the JSON representation and renders it. While this
sounds simple enough, Google Chrome, one of the world&rsquo;s most popular
browsers
<a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=108766">totally breaks this</a>. A
good example of this weird behaviour can be seen <a href="http://chrome-json-bug.heroku.com/docs">here</a>.</p>

<p>I ran in to this issue while playing around with <a href="http://expressjs.com/">Express JS</a>.
Now, the interesting thing here is that the Chrome developers seem to
have closed the issue without providing any convincing answers or
indicating whether they would fix this.</p>

<h2 id="vary-accept-to-the-rescue:81ded0c677aedede844b66006f9428ca">Vary: Accept to the rescue?</h2>

<p>One of the
<a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=108766#c6">solutions</a>
suggested in the bug discussion is to use the <code>Vary: Accept</code>
header. According to the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.44">specs</a>,
&ldquo;while the response is fresh, whether a cache is permitted to use the
response to reply to a subsequent request without revalidation&rdquo;. In
other words, specifying <code>Vary: Accept</code> tells the client that if there is
a change in the <code>Accept</code> field, the resource in the cache must
be-revalidated. After trying that out and still having to stare at naked
JSON, I was convinced that telling Chrome to
re-validate the resource was the only way to get around this issue. This
leads us to another interesting bug in Chrome.</p>

<h2 id="chrome-ignores-the-no-cache-directive:81ded0c677aedede844b66006f9428ca">Chrome ignores the no-cache directive</h2>

<p>Reading the specs lead me to the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.9.4">Cache-Control</a>
header. According to the specs, &ldquo;If the no-cache directive does not
specify a field-name, then a cache MUST NOT use the response to satisfy
a subsequent request without successful revalidation with the origin
server.&ldquo;. That is exactly what I wanted.
But setting that header did not change anything, I still had naked JSON
when hitting the back button. This led me to
<a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=28035">yet another bug</a>
on Chrome. Chrome seems to completely ignore the <code>no-cache</code>
directive. One of the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=28035#c3">suggestions</a> in the discussion was to use the
<code>no-store</code> directive. That seemed to fix the issue.</p>

<p>But the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.9.2">spec</a>
says <code>no-store</code> directive should be used to prevent the client from
caching any sensitive information. What that means is that the client
will never cache the resource.</p>

<p>The end result is that you would end up with a system with lot of end
points that are not cache-able because if you make them cache-able, Google
Chrome will leave your users staring at naked JSON.</p>

<h2 id="possible-solutions:81ded0c677aedede844b66006f9428ca">Possible solutions</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Use different URLs for different representations. In my case, that
would mean I have <code>/users/sdqali.html</code> and <code>/users/sdqali.json</code> as
URLs for the same resource. This somewhat violates the REST principle.</p></li>

<li><p>Do not cache JSON end points at all. While this would work well for my
small app, this is not an effective solution in the general case.</p></li>
