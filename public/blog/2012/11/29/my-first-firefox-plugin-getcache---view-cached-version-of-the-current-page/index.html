  <h1>My first Firefox plugin: GetCache - View cached version of the current page</h1>
  <span class="post-date">Thu, Nov 29, 2012</span>
      

<p>I released my <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/getcache-ff/">first Firefox plugin</a> today. It
is awaiting review, but if you are adventurous, you can install it right
now. Go on, try it.</p>

<p>After I had written the <a href="/blog/2012/11/28/getcache-a-chrome-plugin-to-view-cached-version-of-the-current-page/">Chrome version</a> yesterday, <a href="https://twitter.com/ManishChaks">Manish</a> suggested
that I should write one for Firefox. There already exist Firfox plugins
that does exactly what GetCache does, but I decided to go ahead and write it
for fun. And of course, the fact that I could publish it without having
to sign up with my Credit Card information was enticing.</p>

<p>There are three approaches to write a Firefox plugin:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/XUL_School/Introduction">Traditional extensions</a> - Uses JAvaScript and XUL.</li>
<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/builder">Jetpacks</a> - Uses
HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Extensions/Bootstrapped_extensions">Bootstrapped extensions</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I decided to go the Jetpack because the development process and
technologies were similar to Chrome plugins. And I had no prior
experience with XUL. Once I had downloaded the SDK and set it up, things
were pretty easy. The
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/docs/sdk/latest/">API</a> is
well documented.</p>

<h2 id="the-api:eb75f3cd376b68e9a96e1ddceafda970">The API</h2>

<p>The bulk of the code is JavaScript. The API is easy to use. The
following snippet adds a widget to the Addon toolbar at the bottom of
the Firefox window:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">    var createWidget = function () {
      new Widget({
        id: &quot;sdqali-getcache&quot;,
        label: &quot;Get Google's cached version of the current page..&quot;,
        contentURL: self.data.url (&quot;images/icon.png&quot;),
        onClick: function(event) {
          loadCachedPage ();
        }
      });
    };
</code></pre>

<h2 id="adding-context-menu-entries:eb75f3cd376b68e9a96e1ddceafda970">Adding context menu entries</h2>

<p>While things were pretty smooth overall, I ran in to a weird edge
case. I wanted a context menu entry that would load the Google cache
page, and I wanted this entry to be available regardless of whether the
user has selected some text in the page or not. The API uses the notion
of
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/docs/sdk/latest/packages/addon-kit/context-menu.html"><code>Contexts</code></a>
o decide when the menu entry will be available. While the API says that
I can use an arrays of <code>Contexts</code>, I had no success with it. I ended up
creating two context menu entries, one attached to the <code>PageContext</code> and
one attached to the <code>SelectionContext</code>.</p>

<h2 id="source:eb75f3cd376b68e9a96e1ddceafda970">Source</h2>

<p>I used this
<a href="http://www.iconfinder.com/icondetails/7065/128/cache_icon">beautiful icon</a>
by Sergio Sanchez Lopez. Since it comes with a GPL license, the plugin
is also licensed under GPL.
I have put the source code on <a href="https://github.com/sdqali/getcache-ff">Github</a>.</p>
