            Running multiple applications in the same Tomcat installation

	<p>This blog post describes how to set up Tomcat to run multiple applications running as separate JVM processes, using the same Tomcat installation. This method utilizes the <code>CATALINA_HOME</code> and <code>CATALINA_BASE</code> environment variables used by Tomcat. I have verified this method against Tomcat version <code>8.0.x</code>; other versions should work the same way.</p>

            Making sense of Cloud Foundry security group declarations

	<span class="post-date">Thu, May 21, 2015</span>

	<p>Cloud Foundry allows fine grained declaration of security groups, down to IP address ranges and Ports. While this provides great flexibility, making sense of why each rule in a security group exists and what each does is really difficult because of the limitations of the security group declaration mechanism.</p>

	<span class="post-date">Wed, May 20, 2015</span>

	<p>This week I have been trying out Cloud Foundry. Today while trying to set up monitoring through AppDynamics, the sample application that I was using started crashing because of a Java memory error. This blog post discusses how to prevent this from happening by configuring Java memory parameters used by the application.</p>

	<span class="post-date">Fri, Aug 8, 2014</span>

	Making a map that shows a disputed territory can be a tricky business. Nation states vigorously contest maps that appear to portray a boundary that challenges what a border looks like. From the Falkland Islands to Kuril Islands; from Western Sahara to Arunachal Pradesh, disputed territories result in omissions, additions and inaccuracies in maps. I grew up looking at maps in books printed by the Oxford Press, that came with a disclaimer in blue rubber stamped across them that stated how the map was wrong.

	I have been playing around with maps a lot these days and have ended up using various tools in the process. This blog post is a way to make a note of these tools for later use. geojson.io Mapbox&rsquo;s geojson.io is a simple tool for creating, editing and sharing maps. It lets you import map data in various formats and has an editor to modify maps. GeoJSON-TopoJSON Jeff Paine&rsquo;s GeoJSON-TopoJSON is a simple tool to convert between the more common GeoJSON format and the TopoJSON format used by libraries like D3.js.

The data is available as files with each line representing a JSON object.

            Clojure Dojo - Levenshtein edit distance

	<span class="post-date">Thu, Mar 20, 2014</span>

	I have been playing around with Clojure and after familiarising myself with the core, I decided to start writing little programs that forces me to choose the right idioms. I am starting off with Levenshtein edit distance of two strings. Levenshtein edit distance Levenshtein edit distance between two string is a way of quantifying how similar or dissimilar they are, lower distance implying higher similarity. The algorithm to calculate Levenshtein distance is fairly simple - the algorithm cares about three operations that can be performed at a particular position in a string to move it towards the other - insertion, deletion and substitution.

            A simple JMeter test with login

	<span class="post-date">Mon, Feb 17, 2014</span>

	I had to set up a JMeter test last week - the test included logging in to a site, and then hitting a bunch of URLs, all of them being GET requests. I found it hard to find a simple documentation that described how to do this - the ones I found were either incomplete or were trying to teach me a large number of things at the same time. So when I figured it out, I decided to write this down, for anyone else finding themselves in the same place as me.

	Last week, at the annual congregation the Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana (S.N.D.P.) Yogam, it&rsquo;s leaders - Vellaapalli Nadesan and his son Thushaar announced that S.N.D.P. is about to form their own political party that will unite Hindus of Kerala under one umbrella. 1 S.N.D.P. and it&rsquo;s leaders are no strangers to threatening to announce their intent to form a political party. 2 They did the same in 2012, generating much talk in Kerala&rsquo;s political landscape.

	Life is the heap of broken pieces of crayons adjacent to that heap of broken pieces of your heart, laying by the heap of bills eclipsing the heap of paychecks and all that was lost while you were busy working hard to create those piles.
