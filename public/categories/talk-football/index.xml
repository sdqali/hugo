      <description>&lt;div class=&#39;post&#39;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div dir=&#34;ltr&#34; style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34; trbidi=&#34;on&#34;&gt;&lt;div dir=&#34;ltr&#34; style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34; trbidi=&#34;on&#34;&gt;I recently did a talk on football and the politics behind it, as part of the Banyan Tree talk series at ThoughtWorks. The slides from the talk can be found &lt;a href=&#34;http://speakerdeck.com/u/sdqali/p/football-as-a-lense&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; on Speakerdeck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;It was great fun for me. I thought I did well. It is a topic I know my way around. The history behind the El Clasico - the Spanish civil war, Franco, the trade unions and Di Stefano was discussed. We also looked at The Old Firm. I also talked about Athletic Bilbao&#39;s use of football as a form of cultural resistance. The last parts of the talk were about multiculturalism, united Europe and football as a globalized game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;About 20 people turned up and while most of them liked it, some had the opinion that they needed to understand more European history to fully appreciate it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
