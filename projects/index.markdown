These are some of the side projects I work on.

## Share With Title
Share With Title is an Android application that makes it easy to share URLs with their titles to any application seamlessly. You can find it on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.sdqali.share.withtitle).

## Gist Blog
[Gist Blog](http://gb.sadique.io) lets users share GitHub gists as reader friendly blog posts. This is a pure client side implementation.

## Status Cake Alarm
[State Cake Alarm](https://github.com/sdqali/status_cake_alarm) sounds an alarm when your website goes down. It uses the [Status Cake](https://www.statuscake.com/) API to check for availability of the site.

## Varnam Project
[Varnam project](http://www.varnamproject.com/) is an Open Source Project containing a set of cross-platform opensource tools to help you input in any Indian languages. I worked on the [Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/varnam-ime/abcfkeabpcanobhdmcmdabejaamephaf) and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/varnam-transliteration-base/) plugins for the project.
