      <title>On Inverness</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago, I was in the Scottish Highlands - soaking in the beauty of the city of Inverness, hiking through the South Loch Ness trail and traveling across the Black Isle. It was a wonderful trip - one that I wish was longer. This was a trip that invoked so many memories in me - among other things, of a man whose voice was part of growing up. A voice that traveled from the BBC Studios in the United Kingdom halfway across the globe and into a radio set in South Malabar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, as far as I can remember, I have always wanted to go to Inverness. That may sound crazy, but the name Inverness had been irreversibly etched in my mind when I was a small kid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was growing up, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have access to a television. Initially it was because my family couldn&amp;rsquo;t afford one and later when we could, my mom felt that it would have bad influence on her kids. My portal to the world was a Sony radio that my father had brought us from Jeddah where he was working at that time. It had the ability to receive both AM and FM signals and you could listen to the BBC World Service, Deutsche Welle Radio, Voice of America and many many more stations in languages that I did not understand. Not that I understood English well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://sdqali.in/images/inverness-sunset.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&amp;quot;Sunset in Inverness&amp;quot;&#34; title=&#34;Sunset in Inverness&#34; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A sunset in Inverness&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The BBC World Service had a Premier League program on Saturdays and Sundays. The program was a multi-cast of games around England, switching from stadium to stadium as goals were being scored, fouls were being awarded and referees were raising very late offside flags. Occasionally, they will switch to a stadium in Scotland when the Glasgow derby was in play. So many of my early memories of being a football fan happened around that radio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the matches were finally over and the spectators headed home or to the pub or to curry houses in England and Scotland and people went to sleep in the Indian Sub-continent, a man&amp;rsquo;s very distinct voice would come out of the radio - carried by electromagnetic waves across the Indian Ocean. James Alexander Gordon &lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; started announcing the final scores in the games of that evening across England, Scotland, Wales and occasionally Ireland in his methodical, deliberate voice. And there I would lay in a mattress made of coconut leaves boiled and interwoven by mother&amp;rsquo;s tenacious hands topped with sheets, listening to the melody announcing the results of a recreational activity played thousands of miles away. Of course, I would not learn that this was Gordon until much later in my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gordon always started with England - all 6 divisions of it starting from the Premier League and moved on to Scotland. And somewhere in the middle of the Scottish scores depending on their fortunes at that time, would come the name &amp;ldquo;Inverness Caledonian Thistle &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;. &amp;ldquo;Inverness Caledonian Thistle&amp;rdquo; - what a beautiful name, I will tell myself. Even better than Hearts of Midlothian and Queen of the South. After weeks of falling in love with the name, I wondered where Inverness was. The maps I had access to did not show Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But eventually I had access to maps-of all kinds of places. I read a lot about Inverness in the pages of the World Book Encyclopedia in my school&amp;rsquo;s library. And once I had figured out where it was, I started wishing to go there one day. That was a foolish dream if there was one - international trips were not exactly at the top of the ladder of things my family and I needed or wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet, two weeks ago, there I was. Staring at the Thistle&amp;rsquo;s Caledonian Stadium. I had made it, almost 16 years later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Alexander_Gordon&#34;&gt;James Alexander Gordon&lt;/a&gt; was a legendary BBC broadcaster responsible for reading the results of football. He read results for nearly 40 years from 1974 to 2013. Gordon had a very distinctive style. Gordon explains his style in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcNmtpTsIfM&#34;&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt;.

      <title>Giving up the Samba for the Tiki-taka</title>
      <link>https://sdqali.in/blog/2012/08/21/giving-up-the-samba-for-the-tiki-taka/?utm_source=site&amp;utm_medium=feed</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 21 Aug 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://sdqali.in/blog/2012/08/21/giving-up-the-samba-for-the-tiki-taka/?utm_source=site&amp;utm_medium=feed</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A shot flew over the bar. The goal keeper showed great urgency in
collecting the ball from behind the goal. Instead of kicking it forward, he pushed the ball
gently out to the centre back. As the opposition forward streamed
forward to close him down, the defender moved the ball swiftly and pushed it to
the right back who was level with the penalty box. Another push and the
central mid fielder was brought in to the play. A through ball to the
left found the player on the left wing and as the opposing
right back zoomed in to focus, he played it back to his left back. As
the left back controlled the ball, his
team repositioned themselves to start from scratch all over again. To build
from the back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have watched football in the recent past, you would recognise a
pattern here. You would see the unmistakable Barcelona blueprint. Except
that I am not describing Barcelona. Not even Spain. In fact when the
initial shot flew over the bar, there was no collective sigh of relief
from a crowd [packed till the heavens](&amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://mkbarcelona.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/200311-005.jpg&amp;quot;&#34;&gt;http://mkbarcelona.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/200311-005.jpg&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;),
there was no eager ball boy to throw the ball back at the keeper and
there was no one in the dug out shouting instructions at the
players. Hell, there was not even a dug out near the touch line. The
keeper ran to the construction site where the ball had found it&amp;rsquo;s way
through and ran back all the way to get the play restarted. As he was
still was running back, the left back of my opponents walked back to his
position, his face embellished with a smile bore out of his pride
of having bent his shot around the cashew tree inside the
ground.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This place is home. As I run back to my own position of a centre back, I realize
that my heart is beginning to swell with pride and my mind with perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have come home to &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kottakkal&#34;&gt;Kottakkal&lt;/a&gt; to celebrate Eid-ul-Fitr and find myself in the
middle of this engrossing contest. I grew up here and know almost all
these lads since I was a kid. The change in their playing style and more
importantly what they appreciate and look for in a player is astronomic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kottakkal is in Malappuram, one of the handful of football crazy islands
in a sea of Cricket named India. I am immensely proud of the fact that I
was born and raised here and learned to play football here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://sdqali.in/images/football_flags.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&amp;quot;L to R - Flags of England, Brazil and Portugal&amp;quot;&#34; title=&#34;L to R - Flags of England, Brazil and Portugal&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malappuram loves football and that is a proper understatement. Makeshift
stadiums on paddy fields attract 10k+ crowd during the hot
summer. People attend weddings wearing their football team shirts. Being
able to play football well is a matter of pride and local enterprises
spend a lot of money to sponsor local tournaments and local teams. There
are people who have never flown a flag of India, but who decorates the
streets with their favourite football team&amp;rsquo;s flags. Family connections
are forgotten and friendships are forged based on what teams people
support. 12 foot cut-outs of players adorn streets when major
tournaments are around the corner. Elderly men discuss the role of a
withdrawn forward while sipping glasses of tea in tea shops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://sdqali.in/images/poster_portugal.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&amp;quot;Poster of the Portugal team&amp;quot;&#34; title=&#34;Poster of the Portugal team&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People of Malappuram madly love Brazil. While there is a significant
minority that subscribes to the other Latin American school of football
hailing from Argentina
and there does exist pockets that adore the Italians, the Germans, the
Portuguese and the English, Brazil is king. The fans of Brazil in
Malappuram are large in number, immensely proud and deafeningly
vocal. The Brazilian way of playing is revered and kids copy moves and
fashion their game around Brazilian legends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://sdqali.in/images/poster_brazil.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&amp;quot;Poster of the Brazil team&amp;quot;&#34; title=&#34;Poster of the Brazil team&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But one can not escape the growing feeling that things are
changing. While it would be ridiculous to even suggest that Brazil&amp;rsquo;s fan
base in Malappuram is eroding, people are moving away from the
Brazilian style. Announcements through the tannoy for tournaments
mention tiki-taka more than they mention the samba, the wee lad on the
left who threads in delicious through balls forward would rather be
called &lt;em&gt;Iniesta&lt;/em&gt; than &lt;em&gt;Kaka&lt;/em&gt; and when you are leading the game, you
openly announce that your team is going to perform &lt;em&gt;tiki-taka&lt;/em&gt; till the
opposition catches up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This change in style has been brought up by two independent events. As
you guessed correctly, the first is the astronomical rise of the
all conquering, beautiful Barcelona way. The second, and less obvious
factor is the abandonment of the Brazilian way by none other than the
likes of Brazil&amp;rsquo;s former coach Dunga.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazil of the yesteryears were pleasing on the eye and effective. This added
with the opportunities to watch the best of Brazilian talent strut it
out in Europe made the powerful style the accepted style in Malappuram.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dunga&amp;rsquo;s Brazil played a brand of football that was effective, but not
necessarily pleasing on the eye. He deployed two screening midfielders
in front of the back four and sought to control the game rather than go
out and go for the neck. There are arguments, no less from the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2012/aug/14/olympics-exposed-flaw-brazilian-football&#34;&gt;great Jonathan Wilson&lt;/a&gt;
that Brazil had been playing with this safety first approach for a long
time now. However under Dunga, Brazil played with a level of pragmatism
that had not been seen from them before. This is symbolised by Dunga&amp;rsquo;s
use of Felipe Melo a tenacious, hard tackling, no nonsense defensive
midfielder. Melo and Brazil beat most of the teams that came across
their path and went on to win the Copa America. Brazil started grinding
out results, although it has to be said that their graft looked more
beautiful than watching some of the lesser teams like England trying to
grind out a result. Brazil were no longer exciting to watch. This would
go on till Dunga&amp;rsquo;s departure after a Dutch team who were more organised
than them and showed more desire knocked them out of the World Cup in
2010. Incidentally, Felipe Melo was sent off in that match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile in Catalonia, a master named Pepe Guardiola had assembled a
team that was mighty effective, beautiful and had the neutrals purring
with admiration. Barcelona was in vogue and the definition of beautiful
football in Malappuram changed gradually from Brazilian flair to the
measured, controlled infusion of the right amount of passing, pressing
and possession. Through balls, or &amp;ldquo;passing the ball to space&amp;rdquo; as Xavi
Hernandez &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2011/feb/11/xavi-barcelona-spain-interview&#34;&gt;would have you believe&lt;/a&gt; became more valuable than step
overs. People demanded passes from goalkeepers instead of a kick
forward. Brazil fans started grudgingly accepting the fact that the
Barcelona way was beautiful. The effectiveness of the Barcelona way was
something you could not doubt, evidenced by their steam rolling of
everyone in sight. On the other hand, effectiveness of the Dunga way was
questionable after the World Cup exit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there is a quantum shift in playing style and appreciation, Brazil
is still the most popular team. Despite their love for the Barcelona
way, fans of Brazil continue to be fans of Brazil. Kids go out to the
paddy fields and laterite rockbeds and play in the Bercelona way but when they
 come back, they huddle in front of TVs and cheer for Brazil. After all, if there is one
thing worse than inglorious performances from one&amp;rsquo;s team for a football
fan, it is the shame of having to switch allegiances.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Curse of the Community Shield?</title>
      <link>https://sdqali.in/blog/2012/08/15/curse-of-the-community-shield/?utm_source=site&amp;utm_medium=feed</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Click on the image to see the visualisation:
&lt;a href=&#34;https://sdqali.in/visualizations/community_shield/index.html&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://sdqali.in/images/community_shield.png&#34; alt=&#34;Community Shield visualisation&#34; title=&#34;Community Shield Visualisation&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;context&#34;&gt;Context&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The football season in Europe began this weekend with countries hosting
their equivalents of the &lt;em&gt;Super Cup&lt;/em&gt;. For those confused as to what a
super cup, the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_cup&#34;&gt;Wikipedia entry&lt;/a&gt; is a good
starting point. Super cups, at least in European national
leagues are curtain-raisers for the season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FA &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Community_Shield&#34;&gt;Community Shield&lt;/a&gt;
is England&amp;rsquo;s Super Cup and it pits the winners of the FA Cup against the
winners of the Premier League from the previous season. This year&amp;rsquo;s game saw Manchester City
beat Chelsea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Winning the Community Shield at the beginning of the
season is considered a bad omen by a lot of football fans - an indicator that the team who win it
would not win the subsequent league season. This supposed curse is
widely discussed in
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.redcafe.net/f6/curse-community-shield-165424/&#34;&gt;fan forums&lt;/a&gt;
and
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2005/jan/26/theknowledge.sport&#34;&gt;blog posts&lt;/a&gt;. And
what would be complete on the Internet without a &lt;a href=&#34;http://9gag.com/gag/5030472&#34;&gt;dinosaur thinking
aloud&lt;/a&gt; about it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Community Shield win has the
potential to positively influence how a football team performs in the
season. People love winning and a victory against an opposition that
beat them to win another trophy last season should act as a confidence
booster. But does this happen? What correlation exists between winning a
Super Cup and the team&amp;rsquo;s performance in the subsequent season?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to see this and decided to create this visualisation. It shows
teams that won the Community Shield since 1908 and their position in the
table for the ensuing season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The visualisation is &lt;a href=&#34;https://sdqali.in/visualizations/community_shield/index.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;winners&#34;&gt;Winners&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you observe the visualisation, there are a lot of seasons for which
there are no winners. These seasons fall in to two sets. The first set
signify the time period when the world wars meant there was no
Football. The second set is more interesting in that invitation teams
won the Community Shield and since these teams don&amp;rsquo;t compete in the
League, they are absent from the visualisation. The invitation
teams to have won the Community Shield are &lt;em&gt;English Professionals XI&lt;/em&gt;,
&lt;em&gt;English Amateurs XI&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;English World Cup XI&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also some seasons when there are two winners shown on the
visualisation. This is due to the fact that until early 1990s, a draw in
a Community Shield match meant that the teams shared the trophy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;obervations&#34;&gt;Obervations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Until the 1970s, winners of the Community Shield did not do well in
the league.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From 1908 to 1970, only 6 teams went on to win the league after
winning the curtain raiser.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The lowest point belongs Manchester City, who won the league in the
&lt;sup&gt;1936&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;37&lt;/sub&gt; season and the Community Shield in 1937 and then went on to
get relegated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since the 1970s winners of Community Shield had better performances in
the league.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This trend was first set by the all conquering Merseyside teams of the
1970s and 1980s.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Between 1970 and 1990, 6 teams went on to win the league after winning
Community  Shield.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manchester United set a similar trend in the early 2000s.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After 1970s, the winners of Community Shield have done well. Winners
finished 6th or better in all seasons since 1970, except for 5 times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks like winning the Community Shield no longer incur a curse on the winners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;code&#34;&gt;Code&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data was pulled from Wikipedia and cleaned up using Excel. The
visualisation was created using &lt;a href=&#34;http://d3js.org&#34;&gt;d3.js&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, the code and data used for this project is available on
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sdqali/community_shield&#34;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;. I would greatly appreciate
feedback on this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Visualisation - How European clubs dominate their leagues</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Click &lt;a href=&#34;https://sdqali.in/visualizations/league_champions/index.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the visualisation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a visualization showing how various European football clubs have
dominated their respective national leagues over various time
periods. The visualization shows data for England, France, Germany,
Italy, Netherlands and Spain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The visualization is self-explanatory. You can choose a league to view
from the dropdown and then choose the sliders to select an era for which you want to look
at the data. For fine adjustment, after clicking on either slider, you
can use your keyboard to select a time period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;interesting-trends&#34;&gt;Interesting Trends&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athletic_Bilbao&#34;&gt;Athletic Bilabo&lt;/a&gt; was very dominant in Spain during the first 20 years
of the La Liga from 1930 to 1950. However, throughout the rest of the
time period, FC Barcelona and Real Madrid CF have absolutely dominated
La Liga.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torino_F.C.&#34;&gt;Torino&lt;/a&gt; dominated Italian
football in the 1940&amp;rsquo;s, winning 5 league titles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Except for the period between 2002 and 2008, French Ligue 1 had a lot
of variety in terms of League champions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_M%C3%B6nchengladbach&#34;&gt;Borussia Mönchengladbach&lt;/a&gt;
had a golden period in the 1970&amp;rsquo;s, winning 5 titles. They have never
won the Bundesliga in any other decade. While it would appear that
Bayern Munich totally dominates German football, they won exactly 1
title in the 40 years between 1927 and 1967.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regardless of the era, Ajax has dominated Dutch football.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the 30 year period between 1962 and 1992, the English league
invariable went to Merseyside. Liverpool won 13 and Everton won 4.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;motivation&#34;&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I happened to read this
&lt;a href=&#34;http://frenchfootballweekly.com/2012/07/13/paris-saint-germain-forget-the-fans-its-all-about-winning/&#34;&gt;brilliant piece&lt;/a&gt;
from French Football Weekly on how Paris Saint-Germain&amp;rsquo;s and their
Qatari owners&amp;rsquo; desire to buy their way in to success may not be in the
best interest of the French game. Among other things, the author points
out that the last five years have shown that anybody can mount a title
challenge and this kind of diversity in contenders for the title is
unique in Europe. That was an Aha! moment. While the list of French
champions for the last five years reads &amp;ldquo;Lyon, Bordeaux, Marseille,
Lille, Montpellier&amp;rdquo;, few would have forgotten how Lyon won 7 consecutive
titles from the 2001-2002 season to 2007-2008 season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This kept me thinking about during certain time periods, certain teams
tend to dominate their leagues to a great extend. Other illustrious
examples similar to Lyon include Manchester United in the 1990s,
Liverpool in the 1970s and 80s, Torino in the 1940s and Borussia
Mönchengladbach in 1970s. I decided to create the above visualization to
make sense of this trend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;exaplanation&#34;&gt;Exaplanation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treemapping&#34;&gt;Treemap&lt;/a&gt;. A treemap
recursively divides area to in to rectangles, and the area of any node
is proportional to it&amp;rsquo;s value. This is a treemap of depth &lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt;, where the
relationship is essentially &lt;code&gt;Club -&amp;gt; Championship Years&lt;/code&gt;. You can see a
more comprehensive example of a Treemap visualization with more depth &lt;a href=&#34;http://mbostock.github.com/d3/ex/treemap.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;code&#34;&gt;Code&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the data was obtained from Wikipedia. I used
&lt;a href=&#34;http://d3js.org&#34;&gt;d3.js&lt;/a&gt; to create the visualizations, and

&lt;div&gt;&lt;div dir=&#34;ltr&#34; style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34; trbidi=&#34;on&#34;&gt;&lt;div dir=&#34;ltr&#34; style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34; trbidi=&#34;on&#34;&gt;I recently did a talk on football and the politics behind it, as part of the Banyan Tree talk series at ThoughtWorks. The slides from the talk can be found &lt;a href=&#34;http://speakerdeck.com/u/sdqali/p/football-as-a-lense&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; on Speakerdeck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;It was great fun for me. I thought I did well. It is a topic I know my way around. The history behind the El Clasico - the Spanish civil war, Franco, the trade unions and Di Stefano was discussed. We also looked at The Old Firm. I also talked about Athletic Bilbao&#39;s use of football as a form of cultural resistance. The last parts of the talk were about multiculturalism, united Europe and football as a globalized game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;About 20 people turned up and while most of them liked it, some had the opinion that they needed to understand more European history to fully appreciate it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Athletic - The European campaign and a Basque special</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;The last time I wrote about Athletic, they were relinquishing at the bottom of the La Liga table, their record as one among the only three clubs in La Liga to have never got relegated in threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than a year later, things are really looking up at The Catedral. They managed to finish at seventh in the La Liga last season, qualifying for the Europa Liga. They are flying in Europa Liga this season, they are almost on the verge of breaking into the European qualifying positions again, they have one of La Liga&amp;rsquo;s most promising youngsters in Iker Muniain, and in typical Basque tradition, they are going to play in the knockout matches in Europe with &amp;lsquo;Euskadi&amp;rsquo; proudly written in front of their shirts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-european-campaign-so-far&#34;&gt;The European campaign so far:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Athletic had a bad start to their European campaign, losing 0-1 to the cutely named BSC Young Boys of Switzerland at the San Mames, in the qualifying round. But they bounced back to beat the Swiss 2-1 at the Stade de Suisse in Bern. Fernando Llorente and the youngster Iker Muniain scored for Athletic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They were pitted against the Norwegian side Tromso in the playoffs. Athletic beat the Norwegians 3-2 at home and the match in northern Norway ended in a 1-1 draw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the subsequent group phase, Athletic was put in a group that had Austria Wien, Werder Bremen, and the Protuguese side Nacional. It was a roller coaster ride which saw Athletic beat Wien 3-0 at the San Mames, with a brace from Llorrente and another from Muniain, then they lost 3-1 away to Bremen in north-west Germany; followed by a 2-1 victory against Nacional at home, a 1-1 draw against the same opposition in Madeira, and 3-0 victory over Wien at Vienna. This was followed by a 3-0 drubbing at the hands of Werder at home. In the end the 10 points they earned were enough to send them to the knockout round behind Werder, who managed to pickup 16 points out of a possible 18. In the knockout round of 32, Athletic will face Anderlecht of Belgium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-euskadi-sponsorship-deal&#34;&gt;The Euskadi sponsorship deal:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Basque Country government wanted Athletic to play in the knockout rounds of their European campaigns with Euskadi displayed on their shirts. But EUFA regulations restrict a team shirt from displaying more than one main sponsor&amp;rsquo;s name. So what would the Basque Country and Athletic do? In true Basque fashion, the club&amp;rsquo;s main sponsors Petronor - the Basque petroleum company agreed to willingly forgo the space they &amp;lsquo;own&amp;rsquo; in the front side of the Athletic shirt, to display Euskadi instead, for nothing in return. Athletic has already notified UEFA about the sponsorship change, and they have already unveiled the new kit.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Missing the game</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have continued to watch and follow the beautiful game, save for my first few months in Bangalore. This is supposed to be a metro. Well, apparently a metro where people don&amp;rsquo;t give a damn about football. After taking a cable connection, I soon realized that I will have to beg with the cable guy to put on ESPNStar so that I could watch EPL. Pretty soon, Hathway had some issues with ESPNStar, which meant there was no way I could watch ESPNStar. On the weekends, I tried to pursue the cable operator to put on NEO Sports, at least I could watch Bundes Liga and Serie A. He would not budge, and I had to endure the interesting argument that &amp;ldquo;NEO Cricket and NEO Sports are the same&amp;rdquo;. It was tough to accept - in the small village of Vadakkethala, where I hail from, I could watch as much football as I wanted. In Malappuram, if you are a cable TV operator and don&amp;rsquo;t put on channels with football on, God save you. So Bangalore&amp;rsquo;s apparent indifference to football was frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have enjoyed playing the game since I was a small kid, and that habit too has taken a hit since I came to Bangalore. The first time I went to play on a weekend, a guy with a Red and Gold shawl draped around his neck came to the ground and ordered everyone who couldn&amp;rsquo;t speak Kannada out of the ground. Since then, I have come to realize and acknowledge the power of the Red and Gold colors in Bangalore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do manage to play the game once in a while, mainly at a ground in JP Nagar. I am planning to soon join fellow Malayalees playing in a ground in Koramangala.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for watching Football, I have bought a Videocon d2h which gives me all the sports channels I want, and all the Malayalam channels the diamond pack offers is an added advantage. No more arguments with the cable TV guy about NEO Sports and NEO Cricket being two channels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope to watch and play a lot of football.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Yet another week in Bangalore</title>
      <link>https://sdqali.in/blog/2009/08/16/yet-another-week-in-bangalore/?utm_source=site&amp;utm_medium=feed</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 16 Aug 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://sdqali.in/blog/2009/08/16/yet-another-week-in-bangalore/?utm_source=site&amp;utm_medium=feed</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yet another week of my Bangalore life has unfolded. It was tougher, and better than the first two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned lots of new stuff, stuff that would greatly help me in my profession. I made friends with new people. But most important of all, I got some feedback on some of the things I do in life. It was kind of very scary, to be honest. But then I realized that the feedback will let me improve. I am trying hard to use the feedback in the most positive way possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally was able to enjoy some football. It was the friendly between Netherlands and England. Since England was playing away, Sony Pix did not care to telecast it. I had to listen to BBC Radio 5 Live on the web. It was kind of nostalgic. It reminded of the Saturday and Sunday evenings, when I would sit and listen to the commentary of English Premier League on BBC World Service. The only place where people watched live football was in the local sports club, and I was not allowed to go there after the evenings. So I would sit and listen to the commentary, broken every five minutes by the latest breaking news, alerts on goals in football matches elsewhere, and tennis and golf updates. I think football commentary on Radio is more descriptive and the commentators (at least the better ones) really manage to give you a mental picture of the distribution of players on the field, and the movement of players. The commentary on Radio 5 Live was good too. May be I am biased; the commentary I used to hear on World Service seems to be better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I watched the first day of English Premier Leagues. Chelsea seems to have transformed under Ancellotti; they passed the ball brilliantly. The only flipside for Chelsea fans would have been the sight of Stephen Hunt celebrating the opening goal. A collision with the former Reading winger two seasons ago left Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech with an injured head and the Czech still wears protective head-gear while playing. The Stamford Bridge faithful let Hunt know they did not like him by booing every instant he touched the ball. But Hunt did manage to score the new season&amp;rsquo;s first goal. Didier Drogba scored two amazing goals –the first was a breathtaking free kick. The second one looked more like an attempted cross and Drogba admitted it in the post match interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arsenal ran riot against Everton, and they won 6-1. It was sad to see some of the Goodison Park faithful booing David Moyes&amp;rsquo;s team. Wigan beat Aston Villa to earn the first surprise result of the season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friends had a get together back at Manjeri. Talked to them while the party was on. Really miss those guys! Wanted to be there.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>https://sdqali.in/blog/2009/08/08/bangalore-journal/?utm_source=site&amp;utm_medium=feed</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is my 13th day in Bangalore. And the first week of my training at ToughtWorks has gone by. I learned lots of stuff, talked to some great people and made friends with some of them. I still have not overcome the difficulties of adapting to life in the City. May be I will soon, or I never will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had planned to post everyday about my experiences in TWU. But I did not have much time. The sessions last till 5:00 pm, and then I will be very tired to do much. I am really missing football. I had hoped to play with my friend Aneesh on last Sunday, but we were not allowed to play as one old guy who turned up decided that only regulars could play there. Sigh !!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the positive things have been that my flatmate is an amazing person. He is a leftist, and it seems we share the same view on all kind of issues. We have heated and passionate discussions/debates/arguments about all kind of things under the sun -politics, the economy, religion and technology. The fact that we have the same views on almost all issues allows us to go deep in to the subject and have very intellectually simulating discussions. The discussions continue till late in the night. He is a software engineer of tremendous experience, and I hope I will learn some things from him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the personal front, I have a big decision to make, but I am confused like anything. For the time being, I am going to play the &amp;lsquo;wait-and-watch&amp;rsquo; game. Hope things turn out well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The football season is kicking off tomorrow with the FA Community Shield. Looking forward to watching ManUtd in the new kit, with Rooney playing as the striker. The transfer market has almost died down, with Xabi Alonso&amp;rsquo;s move to Madrid being the last significant transfer. Sunderland is splashing lots of money, Darren Bent being the latest player to be on the payroll at the Stadium of Light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happened to read the incredible story of Wimbledon AFC&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/news/5989930/AFC-Wimbledon-face-Luton-Town-in-Blue-Square-Premier-after-four-promotions.html&#34;&gt;remarkable rise&lt;/a&gt; through the Football pyramid. The fact that thy are playing Luton Town in the season opener is kind of an irony. Wimbledon AFC&amp;rsquo;s rise and Luton Town&amp;rsquo;s fall epitomizes everything the game of football represents - ecstasy and agony; pain and joy; dizzying heights and demoralizing lows. Good luck to AFC Wimledon! They did a tremendous job of rebuilding after their proud club was &amp;lsquo;moved&amp;rsquo; to Milton Keynes and re-branded as MK Dons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During one of heated debates with my friend, he made the point that the issue of Palestine had become one of &amp;lsquo;my ego&amp;rsquo;. I know I am emotional about Palestine, but is it a matter of ego for me? I am not sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next week will see me and my fellow trainees at ThoughtWorks get some hands-on coding training. I am really looking forward to it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>When I used to love Cricket</title>
      <link>https://sdqali.in/blog/2009/02/26/when-i-used-to-love-cricket/?utm_source=site&amp;utm_medium=feed</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://sdqali.in/blog/2009/02/26/when-i-used-to-love-cricket/?utm_source=site&amp;utm_medium=feed</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Taking a tour through the orkut albums of some of my friends from my school, I happened to see a photo of us in the playground, shot after a game of cricket. And there I was - thin, short and most surprisingly for me, with a cricket bat in my hand. True, I have seen the photo a number of times, I had even commented on it, but today, the bat in my hand reminding me solidly that I once used to play cricket and love it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-hWsuR3VWy9I/SabRvGVCWSI/AAAAAAAAAyc/oSjcdEsGsmE/s673/ckt.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;Good-old days: With friends after a game&#34; title=&#34;Good-old days: With friends after a game&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Good-old days: With friends after a game&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, football was the favorite sport, but the students in the school loved playing cricket. One of the prime reasons was that Mr.P, the man in charge of Sports and Physical Education possessed a not so great opinion of Cricket. So he restricted the students from playing Cricket other than on Sundays. On the other hand, playing football was widely promoted - if you just wanted to juggle the ball alone, you could have a ball issued your name, such was the number of balls. There used to be around 10-12 different football matches in progress simultaneously in the playground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr.P&amp;rsquo;s honest comments about cricket included &amp;ldquo;anybody could play cricket, even somebody who was not physically fit&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Cricket as a game cannot contribute to physical well being&amp;rdquo; and quite simply &amp;ldquo;Playing cricket in the ground destroys the window panes !&amp;rdquo;. The third point he made was what made the authorities sanction the restriction on cricket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The restrictions imposed on Cricket was counterproductive. It induced a greater love for the game and Cricket thrived in hostel corridors, places behind the hostels and inside new buildings being built. It was &amp;ldquo;gully&amp;rdquo; cricket and inside the walls, &amp;ldquo;County&amp;rdquo; was what we used to cal it. It was all &amp;ldquo;under-arm&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;hit-a-six-you-are-out&amp;rdquo;,and &amp;ldquo;no-shots-on-the-legside&amp;rdquo;. The bats were made out of planks the construction workers used to support the concrete, and balls were either rubber-balls or made out of socks filled with paper and a small piece of rock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any word about &amp;ldquo;County&amp;rdquo; would be incomplete without a mention of Kandahar. Kandahar was the most famous County venue. Kandahar was the concrete slab of septic tank of the new hostel building under construction and the areas around it. As it was wedged between the compound wall and the building, the occasional tours by teachers near the hostels failed to disrupt the flow of the game at Kandahar. The name Kandahar was coined after the (in)famous hostage drama at Kandahar in Afghanistan involving an Indian flight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was a good County player, I used to love hitting the balls bowled under-arm, as they were always under the knees and cried to be hit. I enjoyed bowling too - both off-spin and leg-spin (When you bowl underarm, it is very easy).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Sundays, when we did have the permission to play cricket in the main ground, all of us couldn&amp;rsquo;t play - you cannot have 10 simultaneous games of cricket in a ground, we managed three or four. The part of the ground that contained the main pitch in the centre was the most valuable piece of earth on Sundays, and we used to go to extremes to ensure that we got it. If you wanted to play in a pitch, you had to &amp;ldquo;book&amp;rdquo; the pitch before everyone else. &amp;ldquo;Booking&amp;rdquo; involved writing stuff like &amp;ldquo;Booked by Shiwalik 11th&amp;rdquo; on the sand. There was an unwritten rule that whoever &amp;ldquo;booked&amp;rdquo; a pitch after 12:00 AM on a Sunday had the right to play there. And bookings went to the wire, invariably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was the one responsible for &amp;ldquo;booking&amp;rdquo; the pitch for my friends from our hostel -Shiwalik. I remember waking up at 3:00 am, and pleading with the house captain for the key to the doors. Gradually, others began to push the boundaries and it became very competitive. There were incidents of a pitch being &amp;ldquo;booked&amp;rdquo; at 12:00 am. Such was the wish to play cricket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in spite of my abilities for booking the centre-pitch, and my prowess in playing &amp;ldquo;County&amp;rdquo;, I was very bad at the real game. My batting was poor, bowling laughable. Fielding was the only thing I could do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we were in 11th standard, cricket inside the walls got a huge boost, as a great gentleman named Subith was appointed our Computer teacher. He joined us for games of cricket on Sundays and since he was very good at playing, everyone enjoyed it. He was great company, too. You could talk your heart out to him, and trust him to not to tell other teachers. We, teenagers inside the walls really needed someone like him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My love for cricket died the day I stepped out of the gates. There I was, free to play any game I wanted, with nobody to tell me not to play a game. And I always had greater love for football than cricket, and so I chose football.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really miss the race to &amp;ldquo;book&amp;rdquo; the pitch, the wooden plank bats and the socks-balls.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Athletic Bilbao - Warriors in a world of Mercenaries</title>
      <link>https://sdqali.in/blog/2008/11/08/athletic-bilbao---warriors-in-a-world-of-mercenaries/?utm_source=site&amp;utm_medium=feed</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 08 Nov 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://sdqali.in/blog/2008/11/08/athletic-bilbao---warriors-in-a-world-of-mercenaries/?utm_source=site&amp;utm_medium=feed</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Modern day football has become a professional game of the highest order, where money speaks loudest, player loyalty is as rare as silverware for ManCity, and big clubs poach youngsters from clubs with smaller financial muscle, with trick or crook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amidst all these there still stand a club, who recruit players from their locality, born to their tribe and is even ready to forsake their top-flight status, in order to stick to their principles. Athletic Bilbao, the Spanish club, is a Basque institution that adheres to their &amp;lsquo;la cantera&amp;rsquo; policy so passionately that, no non-Basque player has played for them since 1912.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://lh6.ggpht.com/_bZ_kjFIgY0w/SRVbQyFlrRI/AAAAAAAAAj0/zIOTJ0x1f1Y/athletic.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&amp;quot;For now and forever, Hooray Athletic !&amp;quot;&#34; title=&#34;For now and forever, Hooray Athletic !&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;For now and forever, Hooray Athletic !&amp;rdquo; Image courtesy : www.athletic-club.net&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Basque People are a group of people inhabiting northern parts of Spain and France, areas around the Bay of Biscay. Historically the Basque people have always been in conflict with the Castilles of Central Spain. Athletic Bilbao was started by British workers in the Basque region, in 1902. The club still uses the English version of the word &amp;ldquo;Athletic&amp;rdquo; rather than &amp;ldquo;Atletico&amp;rdquo; more common is Spain, and used by Atletico Madrid. History has it that their red and white stripes were adopted from the shirts worn by Southampton FC in England. Bilbao play their games at the Estadio San Mames, better known as &amp;lsquo;El Catredal&amp;rsquo; because of its vicinity to the Cathredal of San Mames.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Athletic have adhered to their &amp;lsquo;la cantera&amp;rsquo; policy eversince 1912. For the club, it was a way to represent their Basque nationalism, and the case has remained so, throughout the club&amp;rsquo;s history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Athletic was one of the founding members of the La Liga in 1928, and along with Real Madrid CF and FC Barcelona, remain the only clubs that have not been relegated. Throughout 1930&amp;rsquo;s , 40&amp;rsquo;s and 50&amp;rsquo;s Athletic was one of the most successful clubs in Spain, winning 5 La Liga titles and 11 Copa del Reys.This was of course helped by the restriction imposed on foreign players. In the 60&amp;rsquo;s however Real Madrid dominated Spanish football.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 2000, Athletic has been involved more in relegation survival fights than in title challenges. The club narrowly avoided relegation in the 2005-&amp;lsquo;06 and &amp;lsquo;06-&amp;lsquo;07 seasons, with results afvouring them in the last fortnight of the season. This season, Athletic is at the 19th spot, with 5 points from 9 games. But the dismal performances on the field has not affected the club&amp;rsquo;s allegiance to their &amp;lsquo;la cantera&amp;rsquo; policy. The club&amp;rsquo;s official site makes this stance &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.athletic-club.net/web/main.asp?a=2&amp;amp;b=1&amp;amp;c=1&amp;amp;d=0&amp;amp;idi=2&#34;&gt;very clear&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The supporters are right behind the club, and they are not dismayed by the bad results. In a survey conducted by the Spanish newspaper &amp;lsquo;El Mundo&amp;rsquo; in the late 1990&amp;rsquo;s 76 per cent of Athletic&amp;rsquo;s supporters said they would watch Athletic play in the Spanish Segunda , than see the club give up their famous &amp;lsquo;la cantera&amp;rsquo; policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joseba Etxeberria, Athletic&amp;rsquo;s captain, idol and best player symbolizes everything the Basque institution stands for. He has signed a contract with his beloved club, which will see him play his final season at the club for nothing. That is the kind of spirit and loyalty that the Athletic fans admire and live for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Athletic Club Bilbao may not be regular winners on the field, but on the terraces, where loyalty and pride is everything, they are the ultimate team and the ultimate winners. In a footballing landscape dominated by mercenaries, Athletic Club Bilbao are the real warriors, and probably the only ones left.&lt;/p&gt;
