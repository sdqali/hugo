      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this post, I will describe how a neat setup and some discipline will ensure a Jenkins that can be rolled back and recreated very easily - a bullet proof Jenkins setup.  I have been working on configuring our Jenkins instance. This was the first time I had played around with Jenkins. I am fairly comfortable with &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Go&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; from ThoughtWorks Studios. All of my past teams used Go as their tool for continuous delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things I found very different from Go in Jenkins is the absence of the notion of a Pipeline as the basic entity of build, as proposed in &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Continuous Delivery&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;. Although there are plugins to make this available in Jenkins, we decided to go with Jenkins&amp;rsquo; model of Jobs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
