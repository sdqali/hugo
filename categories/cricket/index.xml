      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently a friend and I had an argument about who makes better debuts among Indian and Pakistani cricket players. Now, I am not into cricket. But I do watch the odd matches here and there and am generally aware of what is going on in the game. My stand was that Pakistani players make better debuts compared to Indian players, while my friend was adamant that Indian players make better debuts. My friend is more of a cricket guy than I ever was and he asked me what is the basis of my stand. It was just a gut feel for me and I had to leave it as there was no way for me to prove that my gut feel was correct. But I did want to try, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to see if I could prove my theory. Luckily, Cricinfo has all this data, although they dont make it easy for you to get it. I wrote some scripts to pull this data and decided to visualise this using the awesome d3 library. In the end, this became more about figuring out d3 than winning the argument, but doing this was fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;batsmen&#34;&gt;Batsmen&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://sdqali.in/visualizations/debuts/batsmen.html&#34;&gt;This scatter-plot&lt;/a&gt; shows debut batting performances by all the test players to have ever played for India and Paskistan (Except those players whose batting averages were not computed). As you would have guessed, the blue bubbles are Indian players and the green ones are Pakistanis. The number of runs scored by the each batsman is on the x-axis and batting average in the debut series is on the y-axis. The size of the bubble is representative of the highest score the player scored in the debut series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned some interesting things from this graph:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sunil Gavaskar made an amazing debut. His score card for his debut series in 1971 against the might West Indies of 1970&amp;rsquo;s read like this - Matches: 4, Total Runs: 774, High Score: 220, Batting Average: 154.80, 100s: 4, 50s: 3. That is incredible and adding him to this plot would have totally skewed this plot. So technically, I did not learn about Gavaskar&amp;rsquo;s amazing debut from this plot, but from the process of plotting it. But you get the idea.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It looks like Indian batsmen have historically made slightly better debuts. From my not-so-keen-cricket-lover point of view, anybody who scored 150 runs at an average of 40 had a good debut series. (I chose that arbitrarily, but if you are more of a cricket fan than me, you would have better scales to spot a good debut, and you can draw your own conclusions :-)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;bowlers&#34;&gt;Bowlers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://sdqali.in/visualizations/debuts/bowlers.html&#34;&gt;This scatter-plot&lt;/a&gt; shows debut bowling performances by all the test players to have ever played for India and Paskistan (Except those players who took no wickets and hence is not of interest to us). The X-axis shows bowling average and the Y-axis shows number of wickets. The size of the bubble is representative of the number of wickets the bowler had in his best bowling performance in the debut series. Since it is indicative of only the wickets, players with best performances of &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;76&lt;/sub&gt; would be shown with bubbles of same size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting bits:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pakistani bowlers make better debuts than Indian bowlers. In the crowd of players with a bowling average of less than 35 and 5 wickets of above, Pakistani players dominate. (Again, disclaimer about arbitrary scales to measure a good performance :-)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are a number of Indian bowlers like Dilip Doshi, Shivlal Yadav, Ravichandran Ashwin and Srinivas Venkataraghavn whose debut performances were clear outliers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-code&#34;&gt;The Code&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the code I used to pull data from Cricinfo, the actual dataset and the Javascript code that generated these plots is available &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sdqali/debuts&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; on Github. Feel free to use the dataset to create better visualisations than mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;credits&#34;&gt;Credits&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Srijayanth (&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/craftybones&#34;&gt;@craftybones&lt;/a&gt;) helped me a lot with d3 and choosing the colors for the visualisation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>When I used to love Cricket</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Taking a tour through the orkut albums of some of my friends from my school, I happened to see a photo of us in the playground, shot after a game of cricket. And there I was - thin, short and most surprisingly for me, with a cricket bat in my hand. True, I have seen the photo a number of times, I had even commented on it, but today, the bat in my hand reminding me solidly that I once used to play cricket and love it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-hWsuR3VWy9I/SabRvGVCWSI/AAAAAAAAAyc/oSjcdEsGsmE/s673/ckt.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;Good-old days: With friends after a game&#34; title=&#34;Good-old days: With friends after a game&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Good-old days: With friends after a game&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, football was the favorite sport, but the students in the school loved playing cricket. One of the prime reasons was that Mr.P, the man in charge of Sports and Physical Education possessed a not so great opinion of Cricket. So he restricted the students from playing Cricket other than on Sundays. On the other hand, playing football was widely promoted - if you just wanted to juggle the ball alone, you could have a ball issued your name, such was the number of balls. There used to be around 10-12 different football matches in progress simultaneously in the playground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr.P&amp;rsquo;s honest comments about cricket included &amp;ldquo;anybody could play cricket, even somebody who was not physically fit&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Cricket as a game cannot contribute to physical well being&amp;rdquo; and quite simply &amp;ldquo;Playing cricket in the ground destroys the window panes !&amp;rdquo;. The third point he made was what made the authorities sanction the restriction on cricket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The restrictions imposed on Cricket was counterproductive. It induced a greater love for the game and Cricket thrived in hostel corridors, places behind the hostels and inside new buildings being built. It was &amp;ldquo;gully&amp;rdquo; cricket and inside the walls, &amp;ldquo;County&amp;rdquo; was what we used to cal it. It was all &amp;ldquo;under-arm&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;hit-a-six-you-are-out&amp;rdquo;,and &amp;ldquo;no-shots-on-the-legside&amp;rdquo;. The bats were made out of planks the construction workers used to support the concrete, and balls were either rubber-balls or made out of socks filled with paper and a small piece of rock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any word about &amp;ldquo;County&amp;rdquo; would be incomplete without a mention of Kandahar. Kandahar was the most famous County venue. Kandahar was the concrete slab of septic tank of the new hostel building under construction and the areas around it. As it was wedged between the compound wall and the building, the occasional tours by teachers near the hostels failed to disrupt the flow of the game at Kandahar. The name Kandahar was coined after the (in)famous hostage drama at Kandahar in Afghanistan involving an Indian flight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was a good County player, I used to love hitting the balls bowled under-arm, as they were always under the knees and cried to be hit. I enjoyed bowling too - both off-spin and leg-spin (When you bowl underarm, it is very easy).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Sundays, when we did have the permission to play cricket in the main ground, all of us couldn&amp;rsquo;t play - you cannot have 10 simultaneous games of cricket in a ground, we managed three or four. The part of the ground that contained the main pitch in the centre was the most valuable piece of earth on Sundays, and we used to go to extremes to ensure that we got it. If you wanted to play in a pitch, you had to &amp;ldquo;book&amp;rdquo; the pitch before everyone else. &amp;ldquo;Booking&amp;rdquo; involved writing stuff like &amp;ldquo;Booked by Shiwalik 11th&amp;rdquo; on the sand. There was an unwritten rule that whoever &amp;ldquo;booked&amp;rdquo; a pitch after 12:00 AM on a Sunday had the right to play there. And bookings went to the wire, invariably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was the one responsible for &amp;ldquo;booking&amp;rdquo; the pitch for my friends from our hostel -Shiwalik. I remember waking up at 3:00 am, and pleading with the house captain for the key to the doors. Gradually, others began to push the boundaries and it became very competitive. There were incidents of a pitch being &amp;ldquo;booked&amp;rdquo; at 12:00 am. Such was the wish to play cricket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in spite of my abilities for booking the centre-pitch, and my prowess in playing &amp;ldquo;County&amp;rdquo;, I was very bad at the real game. My batting was poor, bowling laughable. Fielding was the only thing I could do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we were in 11th standard, cricket inside the walls got a huge boost, as a great gentleman named Subith was appointed our Computer teacher. He joined us for games of cricket on Sundays and since he was very good at playing, everyone enjoyed it. He was great company, too. You could talk your heart out to him, and trust him to not to tell other teachers. We, teenagers inside the walls really needed someone like him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My love for cricket died the day I stepped out of the gates. There I was, free to play any game I wanted, with nobody to tell me not to play a game. And I always had greater love for football than cricket, and so I chose football.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really miss the race to &amp;ldquo;book&amp;rdquo; the pitch, the wooden plank bats and the socks-balls.&lt;/p&gt;
