      <title>Yet another week in Bangalore</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yet another week of my Bangalore life has unfolded. It was tougher, and better than the first two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned lots of new stuff, stuff that would greatly help me in my profession. I made friends with new people. But most important of all, I got some feedback on some of the things I do in life. It was kind of very scary, to be honest. But then I realized that the feedback will let me improve. I am trying hard to use the feedback in the most positive way possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally was able to enjoy some football. It was the friendly between Netherlands and England. Since England was playing away, Sony Pix did not care to telecast it. I had to listen to BBC Radio 5 Live on the web. It was kind of nostalgic. It reminded of the Saturday and Sunday evenings, when I would sit and listen to the commentary of English Premier League on BBC World Service. The only place where people watched live football was in the local sports club, and I was not allowed to go there after the evenings. So I would sit and listen to the commentary, broken every five minutes by the latest breaking news, alerts on goals in football matches elsewhere, and tennis and golf updates. I think football commentary on Radio is more descriptive and the commentators (at least the better ones) really manage to give you a mental picture of the distribution of players on the field, and the movement of players. The commentary on Radio 5 Live was good too. May be I am biased; the commentary I used to hear on World Service seems to be better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I watched the first day of English Premier Leagues. Chelsea seems to have transformed under Ancellotti; they passed the ball brilliantly. The only flipside for Chelsea fans would have been the sight of Stephen Hunt celebrating the opening goal. A collision with the former Reading winger two seasons ago left Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech with an injured head and the Czech still wears protective head-gear while playing. The Stamford Bridge faithful let Hunt know they did not like him by booing every instant he touched the ball. But Hunt did manage to score the new season&amp;rsquo;s first goal. Didier Drogba scored two amazing goals â€“the first was a breathtaking free kick. The second one looked more like an attempted cross and Drogba admitted it in the post match interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arsenal ran riot against Everton, and they won 6-1. It was sad to see some of the Goodison Park faithful booing David Moyes&amp;rsquo;s team. Wigan beat Aston Villa to earn the first surprise result of the season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friends had a get together back at Manjeri. Talked to them while the party was on. Really miss those guys! Wanted to be there.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bangalore Journal</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is my 13th day in Bangalore. And the first week of my training at ToughtWorks has gone by. I learned lots of stuff, talked to some great people and made friends with some of them. I still have not overcome the difficulties of adapting to life in the City. May be I will soon, or I never will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had planned to post everyday about my experiences in TWU. But I did not have much time. The sessions last till 5:00 pm, and then I will be very tired to do much. I am really missing football. I had hoped to play with my friend Aneesh on last Sunday, but we were not allowed to play as one old guy who turned up decided that only regulars could play there. Sigh !!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the positive things have been that my flatmate is an amazing person. He is a leftist, and it seems we share the same view on all kind of issues. We have heated and passionate discussions/debates/arguments about all kind of things under the sun -politics, the economy, religion and technology. The fact that we have the same views on almost all issues allows us to go deep in to the subject and have very intellectually simulating discussions. The discussions continue till late in the night. He is a software engineer of tremendous experience, and I hope I will learn some things from him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the personal front, I have a big decision to make, but I am confused like anything. For the time being, I am going to play the &amp;lsquo;wait-and-watch&amp;rsquo; game. Hope things turn out well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The football season is kicking off tomorrow with the FA Community Shield. Looking forward to watching ManUtd in the new kit, with Rooney playing as the striker. The transfer market has almost died down, with Xabi Alonso&amp;rsquo;s move to Madrid being the last significant transfer. Sunderland is splashing lots of money, Darren Bent being the latest player to be on the payroll at the Stadium of Light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happened to read the incredible story of Wimbledon AFC&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/news/5989930/AFC-Wimbledon-face-Luton-Town-in-Blue-Square-Premier-after-four-promotions.html&#34;&gt;remarkable rise&lt;/a&gt; through the Football pyramid. The fact that thy are playing Luton Town in the season opener is kind of an irony. Wimbledon AFC&amp;rsquo;s rise and Luton Town&amp;rsquo;s fall epitomizes everything the game of football represents - ecstasy and agony; pain and joy; dizzying heights and demoralizing lows. Good luck to AFC Wimledon! They did a tremendous job of rebuilding after their proud club was &amp;lsquo;moved&amp;rsquo; to Milton Keynes and re-branded as MK Dons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During one of heated debates with my friend, he made the point that the issue of Palestine had become one of &amp;lsquo;my ego&amp;rsquo;. I know I am emotional about Palestine, but is it a matter of ego for me? I am not sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next week will see me and my fellow trainees at ThoughtWorks get some hands-on coding training. I am really looking forward to it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Off Season</title>
      <link>http://sdqali.in/blog/2009/07/16/off-season/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is going to be yet another entry in the list of posts that depicts boredom more than anything. Post college, waiting to join ThoughtWorks, I have nothing much to do. Of course, I have some study materials to go through, but&amp;hellip;. Well, let me put it this way- I am not neck deep in those materials. Got to complete them if I want to do well at TW , which I want to do of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some football would have cheered me up a bit. But there is no hope on the horizon in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the monsoon coming down heavily, one cannot play football in the paddy fields anymore, and the only field left in the village where we used to play football has been bought by one of truly multi-national spiritual enterprises. So that leaves a small field on a hill as the only venue for the game of football in the evenings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do football in the evenings, but most of my friends would not have returned from work and that leaves me with a bunch of school kids on the ground. But mind you, they are very good players and I must admit that most of them are better players than me. No disappointments- after all this is Malappuram.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in college, I used to play FIFA occasionally. But the computer I have with me now is so outdated it will have a tough job running FIFA 07. (I got to upgrade it soon, that is going to be one of the first things I am gonna do once I start earning my own money!). In the mean time, I am left to play PES 09 on my mobile. But having won the Champions League with AS Roma and the European Championship with England, it is nowhere near interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The summer transfer window in Europe is a no show for everyone except Real Madrid and Manchester City. The Spanish giants have already brought in arguably two of the planets three best footballers in Ronaldo and Kaka. Not to mention Europe&amp;rsquo;s most sought after youngster Karim Benzema and ex-Valencia Spanish international defender Raul Albiol. Liverpool&amp;rsquo;s Xabi Alonso seems to be heading to the Barnabeau. City has brought in Carlos Tevez and Gareth Barry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to make matters more woeful, Manchester United&amp;rsquo;s transfer targets are going elsewhere. United has a transfer kitty of around GBP 100 million, with the lion&amp;rsquo;s share of that coming from the sale of Ronaldo. But United has so far signed only three players- Antonio Valencia, Gabriel Obertan and very surprisingly Michael Owen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Valencia is a very good winger- he can run with the ball, beat a player or two, and deliver a telling a cross. He may not be Ronaldo, but he can do a job on the right wing and unlike Ronaldo, he can be counted on to do some dirty work and tracking back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obertan is a promising youngster who did well for the French U-21 side at the recently concluded Euro U-21 Championship. He will have a tough time breaking in to the first team, with Nani, Tosic and Park vying for the left wing position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot still believe that Michael Owen has become a United player. Almost a Liverpool legend at one point of time, the England international is known for his ability to score goals. In the last two years spent at Newcastle United, plagued by multiple injuries, the Merseyside born striker has been unable to do justice to the great talent he possesses. One can only hope that he stays injury-free and rediscover his goal scoring touch. So that is my boredom chronicle. Hope I will get into more interesting things soon.&lt;/p&gt;
