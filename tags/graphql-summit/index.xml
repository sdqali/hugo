      <description>I had the opportunity to give a talk at GraphQL Summit 2018 about the experience of introducing GraphQL for our Payments API at Braintree. It was well received, as far as I could tell - I received a lot of nice feedback and had great conversations with members of the community.
The slides are available here on SpeakerDeck. I will update this post with links to the video of my talk when it becomes available.</description>
