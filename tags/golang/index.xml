      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Open Graph protocol was designed by Facebook to help content creators generate a richer preview of links to their content when they get posted in to Facebook. It was originally proposed as a simple mark up that can be adopted in platforms beyond Facebook. The Open Graph Protocol Design Decisions presentation &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; does a very good job of enumerating the motivation and design decisions made for Open Graph. I have lately been reading and experimenting with these tags and I notice a fair bit of differences when it comes to how these tags are used by different platforms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
