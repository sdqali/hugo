      <description>Mathew Butterick&amp;rsquo;s Practical Typography 1 features a section dedicated to the History of Times New Roman 2. It is an interesting read.
 Why not? Fame has a dark side. When Times New Roman appears in a book, document, or advertisement, it connotes apathy. It says, “I submitted to the font of least resistance.” Times New Roman is not a font choice so much as the absence of a font choice, like the blackness of deep space is not a colour.</description>

      <title>My Tinfoil setup</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I try to be careful when I use the internet. This is not because I do illegal stuff—I just don&amp;rsquo;t like the idea of random websites tracking me across the web, recording everything I do, and then serving me advertisements. I don&amp;rsquo;t like the idea of technocracies like Facebook collecting and storing data about me, even after I have explicitly quit their colourful walled garden. &lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I don&amp;rsquo;t like Google tracking what websites I read by pretending to provide a service to the creators of those websites in the form of CDN and Analytics. &lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I don&amp;rsquo;t want marketing optimisation services to track me and put me in their funnel, unless I explicitly want to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that when I browse the web, I treat cookies, javascript code and third party content with suspicion. Over the years, my setup has evolved in to something that makes my internet use safe, all the while being useful. These are some of the things I do to ensure that sites are not tracking me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>When URL shortening results in longer URLs</title>
      <link>https://sdqali.in/blog/2013/08/11/when-url-shortening-results-in-longer-urls/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have previously &lt;a href=&#34;https://sdqali.in/blog/2012/07/17/social-networks-and-url-shorteners/&#34;&gt;written&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href=&#34;https://sdqali.in/blog/2012/08/23/dear-content-creator-your-url-shortener-is-pointless/&#34;&gt;how social networks&lt;/a&gt; use URL shortening as a way of obscuring and swallowing information about sharing of content on their platform. In Twitter&amp;rsquo;s case, this means that all URLs are automatically &amp;lsquo;shortened&amp;rsquo; with their &lt;em&gt;t.co&lt;/em&gt; domain. All their official clients take this shortening into account when you create a Tweet so as to avoid a round trip across the network to figure out if the tweet is short enough. But what happens if you are posting a URL that does not require any shortening? Something interesting happens.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Fusing the old media and the new</title>
      <link>https://sdqali.in/blog/2013/08/10/fusing-the-old-media-and-the-new/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;From Kara Swisher&amp;rsquo;s well written &lt;a href=&#34;http://allthingsd.com/20130807/dear-jeff-bezos-heres-what-i-saw-as-an-analog-nobody-in-the-mailroom-of-the-washington-post/?mod=thisweek&#34;&gt;open letter to Jeff Bezos&lt;/a&gt; in the light of the latter&amp;rsquo;s announcement that he has bought the Washington Post:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, the most important trick is to deeply inculcate the joy of Internet journalism, without losing (actually restoring to some degree, after recent cutbacks) the great editorial values and breakthrough journalism of the Post. Fusing the old-media storytelling and news-integrity values that I learned at the Post with the Internet values of speed and personality — and, well, some level of fun at the right times — is critical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, make it clear that it is possible to do great journalism in an Internet way — even more possible because you’re freer and, most of all, readers want to read it that way. That entails inspiring the staffers of the newspaper to create content that is — as it has been — accurate, ethically sound, of high quality, but also much more compelling, and delivered in a way that modern customers want to consume it. Formulate those big stories primarily on the Web, and allow a conversation with readers to bubble up from there.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Internet in Yemen : A Tale of Woe</title>
      <link>https://sdqali.in/blog/2013/08/08/internet-in-yemen-a-tale-of-woe/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Haykal Bafana paints a &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.haykal.sg/index.php/yemen1/20-ec/20-internet-in-yemen-a-tale-of-woe&#34;&gt;sad picture&lt;/a&gt; of the state of internet access in Yemen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each time a saboteur cuts the fiber optic lines in Marib, Internet access in Sanaa and even eastern Yemeni regions such as Hadhramaut are affected severely. Many have asked me before : why should a sparsely populated desert area like Marib be so critical to Yemen&amp;rsquo;s Internet service? A detour into the murky history of Yemeni telecommunications is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My thoughts on Android fragmentation -  It is not a bad thing</title>
      <link>https://sdqali.in/blog/2013/07/30/my-thoughts-on-android-fragmentation-it-is-not-a-bad-thing/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;OpenSignal released the July 2013 edition &lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; of their State of Android report. Among many things like the dominance of Samsung, HTC&amp;rsquo;s faltering performance and Motorola&amp;rsquo;s struggle, it points out that the Android device landscape is more fragmented than ever. Out of &lt;em&gt;682000&lt;/em&gt; devices surveyed for the report, &lt;em&gt;11868&lt;/em&gt; distinct devices were seen. This has met with cries of anguish from Developers and the usual suspects &lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a very important point in the OpenSignal report that gets ignored or does not get as much focus as it deserves. To quote:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For consumers, extreme fragmentation means that they can get exactly the phone they want – big or small, cheap or expensive, with any number of different feature combinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>
