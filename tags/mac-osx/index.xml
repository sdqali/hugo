      <description>I use Emacs as my primary text editor and I use it to edit commit messages for Git. I almost never use the -m option with git commit. Since I have a fairly customised Emacs configuration based around Sam Aaron&amp;rsquo;s Emacs Live, this means that for every commit, there is a visible delay for Emacs to start up for the commit message. I was looking for ways to reduce this and figured out that running Emacs in daemon mode and using emacsclient as the GIT_EDITOR would solve this.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For me the last two weeks or so have involved a lot of wrestling with SSL certificates. One of the things that took some time to figure out was how to piggy-back on the tools provided by different Operating Systems to manage certificates. We did not want to rewrite &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/pki/nss/&#34; title=&#34;NSS&#34;&gt;NSS&lt;/a&gt;. Luckily for us, all the major OSes provide tools to manage certificates from the command line.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I use the flyspell-mode as a spell checking mechanism in emacs. Recently, I moved to Mac OS X, and I began to get this error whenever I started emacs:
Error enabling Flyspell mode: (Searching for program No such file or directory aspell) I had installed aspell with Homebrew. The issue seemed to be that Emacs was unable to find the aspell binary. Homebrew installs binaries in /usr/local/bin and it was in my $PATH.</description>
