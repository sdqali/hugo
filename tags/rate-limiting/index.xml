The first part of this series looked at how to implement basic rate limiting in a Rails application.

Rate limiting or throttling is the practice of limiting how frequently legitimate users of a web service can access the service. Rate limiting is often put in place to prevent the hogging of resources by a sub set of the users of the system. Rate limiting works by responding with error messages when a client exceeds their allocated share of requests within a predefined time window.</description>
