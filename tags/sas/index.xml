      <description>One of the first things I noticed when I started poking around in SAS code is that the input statement is very powerful, flexible and hence sometimes hard to understand. It can read pretty much anything in to a dataset as long as you tell it what to do.
The use of trailing @s to take control of how SAS advances the input pointer is a powerful technique to read from input files where the data is laid out in non-standard formats.</description>

      <description>I have been playing around with SAS for the last two weeks. I started with a SAS University Edition running on a VirtualBox instance on my MacBook, but soon realized that it was way more convenient to use a SAS OnDemand account. Having made the switch, I realized that all learning materials made references to and used examples with datsets from a library named SASUSER.
It was not clear how to get these datasets and use them in SAS Studio.</description>
