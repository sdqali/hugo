      <description>I have been playing around with SAS for the last two weeks. I started with a SAS University Edition running on a VirtualBox instance on my MacBook, but soon realized that it was way more convenient to use a SAS OnDemand account. Having made the switch, I realized that all learning materials made references to and used examples with datsets from a library named SASUSER.
It was not clear how to get these datasets and use them in SAS Studio.</description>
