      <description>

&lt;p&gt;There has been a lot of debate in the tech community about working remotely and the willingness of employers to allow this option to their employees. At the very beginning of my career as a programmer, I had the opportunity to work on a distributed team. While the team was distributed, I was still working from an office and for almost half of the duration of my work on the team I had team members sitting beside me in the same office. Because of this, my scenario may not be representative of the population of programmers who work remotely. However, there are a number of things I learned from the experience that I would like to share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-team&#34;&gt;The Team&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was part of a four developer team, three of whom including me were co-located at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thoughtworks.com/&#34;&gt;ThoughtWorks&lt;/a&gt; office in Bangalore. Our lead developer worked out of his house in the United Kingdom. While he had a great deal of experience writing software, the other team members had 1 year experience. This was the first ever team I was going to be part of and possibly the place where I would pick up important skills and learn a lot. We were writing mostly Ruby and JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-schedule&#34;&gt;The schedule&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our day would start with the three of us in Bangalore splitting in to a pair and a lone developer and working on code. The other developer would join around 9:00 AM GMT (~ 2:30 PM IST) and the lone developer would pair with him. Later, as the work day ended in India, the lead developer would continue to work till his day was over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;communication&#34;&gt;Communication&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We would have a short (~5 minutes) Skype call at the beginning of the UK work day, where we would discuss our progress and any thing else that needed to be shared. We later moved this to the end of the India work day, because this ensured the developers in India could discuss pressing matters and blockers with the lead developer and come back with this context the following day. We always had a private I.R.C. channel running where we could jump in and discuss things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-tools&#34;&gt;The tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While pairing remotely, we almost always used Emacs running in the no-window mode inside a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/&#34;&gt;GNU screen&lt;/a&gt; session. This was great as it was a fast and glitch-free experience. Coding in an IDE and sharing the desktop was too slow. This is where I picked up my Emacs skills. While pairing, we were constantly on a Skype call talking to each other. Being glued to the computer screen for hiurs while talking to somebody over Skype with an earphone plugged in to ears can be a tiring experience. Fortunately, we made sure to take sufficient breaks in between.
We used ThoughtWorks&amp;rsquo; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thoughtworks-studios.com/mingle-agile-project-management&#34;&gt;Mingle&lt;/a&gt; as our project management tool and card wall and it proved to be really useful for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;sane-practices&#34;&gt;Sane practices&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were writing a client side JavaScript application and we were spending most of our time in an SSH session. How did we manage to make sure that things were not breaking? We did have to open up the application in our browsers to see how things got rendered and ensure that the UI workflow we were creating did not break. There are three things that helped us here. While none of these are specific to working remotely, these made life easy for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;good-code-design&#34;&gt;Good code design&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We took great efforts to encapsulate and structure our JavaScript code in to an &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller&#34;&gt;MVC&lt;/a&gt;. This enabled us to focus on and test individual parts of the application while making sure that the rest of the application would not break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;extensive-unit-tests&#34;&gt;Extensive unit tests&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wrote extensive unit tests for our JavaScript code. This kept our code working while evolving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;headless-js-tests&#34;&gt;Headless JS tests&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We used &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Rhino&#34;&gt;Rhino&lt;/a&gt; to run JavaScript tests headlessly. This meant that we could run our tests from our terminals, while both developers looked at the results without having to bring up a browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of these were done because we were a distributed team, it was the way we used to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;mentoring&#34;&gt;Mentoring&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was great to have more experienced developers to work alongside in the same room as you. I got to pair with them and ask questions if I was unable to grasp something. However during the latter half of my work as part of the team, it was just me and the senior developer from U.K. While he took great effort to mentor me, the time difference made it harder for me because for the first half of my work day, I was coding alone and did not have some body experienced to ask questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, I would say that with the right people and the right tools, you can make remote work a good experience for your team. However, if there is someone that needs to be mentored, having the mentor co-located would be a great advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Spiral of Learning</title>
      <link>https://sdqali.in/blog/2012/05/30/the-spiral-of-learning/?utm_source=site&amp;utm_medium=feed</link>

      <guid>https://sdqali.in/blog/2012/05/30/the-spiral-of-learning/?utm_source=site&amp;utm_medium=feed</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;An hour ago, I was staring at a problem on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.4clojure.com/&#34; title=&#34;4clojure&#34;&gt;4clojure&lt;/a&gt; website. Last weekend, I found myself wandering through Zed Shaw&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://c.learncodethehardway.org/&#34; title=&#34;Learn C The Hard Way&#34;&gt;Learn C the Hard Way&lt;/a&gt;. Three days before that, I was taking a stab at figuring what kind of visualizations would make sense if you want to come up with the mother of all comparison&amp;rsquo;s between two of football&amp;rsquo;s greatest ever players. Four days before that, I was looking at some classifiers. Five weeks ago, I was totally lost in &lt;a href=&#34;http://learnyousomeerlang.com/&#34; title=&#34;Learn You Some Erlang For Great Good&#34;&gt;Learn You Some Erlang&lt;/a&gt;, and three weeks before that I was trying to make sense of all the hype around Node.js.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a pattern that I have experienced throughout the last three years of my life. The technologies and tools might have been different, but the experience and the pain that leaves me in have been consistent and consistently high, respectively. I would pick up something, throw all my energy at it and would learn some stuff. And then, the day when I don&amp;rsquo;t have the energy or enthusiasm for anything comes up. I would sit there jumping between Wikipedia pages. This loss of interest would be temporary, and the following day I would have all the energy and enthusiasm in the world. And then the bad thing happens - I don&amp;rsquo;t go and pick up what I left mid-way. I would get fascinated by something totally new or something I had left halfway through two weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time of writing, I have 32 pet projects in my ~/src/play folder. Only one of them is in a complete state. Those projects totally differ from each other on what they intend to achieve. I have an OCR in there and I have a half-cooked version of what is a web interface for VLC. I have a lot of Shell scripts, Lisp snippets, Haskell, Clojure, Python, Ruby and Java in there. All semi-cooked and to be frank utterly useless. And every time I think about this, I feel bad.

    &lt;/form&gt;
    &lt;p class=&#34;no-spam&#34;&gt;I won&#39;t send you spam. Unsubscribe at any time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

I have been thinking about this a lot lately and increasingly getting concerned. I have slowly realized that there is a lot of stuff that I know bits of, but there is nothing that I have mastered. What I am doing is essentially traveling on a spiral of learning. Despite the fact that I drop and pickup new stuff every other week, I have realized that I do come back to things I abandoned. For example, I have made about 7 stabs at learning Haskell. Each time, either of these things happen - I lose interest because for want of focus or I hit an abrupt spike on the learning curve and fall back hard. But every time I go back, I have observed that I have become a better Haskell programmer. I understand functional programming much better than what I did when I took my first stab at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I have sat down and thought about it, this cycle has happened on almost all the stuff that I have picked up to learn. Arabic, Node.js, Rails, Clojure, Erlang, whatever I always come back to these for a short period of time, only to leave it abruptly. But whenever I leave, I leave with a slightly better understanding of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what I am going through (Apologies for the bad diagram):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://sdqali.in/images/learning_spiral.png&#34; alt=&#34;Learning Spiral&#34; title=&#34;Learning Spiral&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This diagram was created using &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dabbleboard.com/&#34; title=&#34;Dabbleboard&#34;&gt;Dabbleboard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally, one would want the slope of the climb to be constant and time period spent one thing to be longer. In my case, the slop is erratic and the frequency of switching between stuff is big. Over time, there is an accumulation of knowledge and it has a positive gradient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have come to realize that I am not the only one going through this. I have seen a lot of others struggling with the same spiral. From talking to people about this, one possible solution seems to be to put in a strong effort to come back to what you love most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my case, I am not even sure what that is. If my life depended on picking something, I would pick football. May be I should try and do football visualizations or start writing about the areas of football that interest me the most - how football acts as a mirror for the society where it gets played. I am going to try this for some time and see how that turns out. As you can see, I just signed up for one more thing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>You Crash and then You Learn</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I picked up my bicycle, climbed on it and spotted the blood on my elbows and the bunch of curious onlookers in front of the pan shop nearby, I did not feel fear or embarrassment. I had an immeasurable amount of happiness welling inside me. I had finally done what I should have about 20 years ago - I had finally managed to crash my bicycle and leave with plenty of scars to show for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am 25, and until two weeks ago I could not ride a bicycle. Two weeks ago, during a Saturday afternoon, I got on a bicycle and rode it around a football field. Well, what is so special about that, you might ask. It was pretty special to me because it was the first time I had rode a bicycle, where my definition of &amp;lsquo;ride&amp;rsquo; is &amp;lsquo;ride with a level of confidence that removes the fear on falling down!&amp;rsquo;. When it finally happened, it was like what Kevin Garnett &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gL_H9zAY8&#34;&gt;described&lt;/a&gt; when he finally won an NBA with the Celtics after years of disappointment with the Minnesota Timberwolves - &amp;ldquo;I Just Knocked the Bully Out&amp;rdquo;. Yes, I was emotional. No, I did not cry. But it had been a long time coming, and the journey was painful. Here is the story of me learning to cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-beginning&#34;&gt;The beginning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a kid, I did not learn to ride a bicycle. Looking back, I don&amp;rsquo;t know why. All my friends from childhood, who lived in the same neighbourhood as me learned to ride when they were small kids. I think I had developed an aversion to it even when I was a kid. It must have had something to do with me liking swimming in the streams and playing more than riding a bicycle. And yeah, there was the minor detail about neither me or any of my close friends actually owning a cycle.
When I was growing up, I spent most of my time in a residential school. In there, bicycles were a part of your fantasies about the outside world. People talked about it, fantasized about it, but never rode one. Looking back, I wonder what I did during all those vacations I had. I played more football, swam more in the streams and generally went around the village. The fact that I did not know how to ride a bicycle did not bother me in the least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-frustration&#34;&gt;The frustration&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I began to notice this fact and get worried about it when I went to college. Where I went to colllege, Yamaha RX 100s were as uncompromise-able part of life as strike actions and political rallies. This realization soon turned in to a fear. I was keen on learning and tried it on numerous occasions in our football field. But college has an uncompromising way of dealing with such lack of abilities, and that meant that there was a big emotional barrier to overcome. I failed miserably. You see, I am kind of tall, and never fell down from a bicycle. I remember trying to ride the bicycle in the ground in pouring monsoon rains. I was not getting it. As the rain around me grew in force and malice, my impatience and frustration multiplied. That was it. I decided that I would never attempt it again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But despite all those failings, the thing that did most to drain my confidence and enthusiasm did not happen on a bicycle. That important place in my life goes to a Mahindra jeep. Back in college, a group of my friends had this really old crazy Mahindra jeep. A lot of people used it to learn to drive or to hone their driving skills. My baggage of experiences (or the lack of it) meant that I never touched the driving wheel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-shock&#34;&gt;The shock&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One fine Sunday afternoon, we were returning after lunch at this awesome, little place that served kerala rice meals and fish. (This place is called &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ashwathi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and I recommend that if you go to Trivandrum, you should totally go there.) One of my friends who was still learning to drive was driving the jeep and it had around 12 of us inside it. Another friend of mine - S - was instructing him. When we reached the hostel and the football field, S continued to instruct the other friend. All of a sudden, I was inspired. I wanted to learn this thing. It certainly had to be less painful than learning to bicycle, I thought. I asked S if he could teach me. S immediately said Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hostel campus has a road that goes around the five or six buildings and the road&amp;rsquo;s sides are dotted with big, tall cedar trees. I climbed to the driving seat and S took the other front seat. My other fiend sat in the back. I started driving the jeep dead-slowly in the football ground. After 5 minutes or so, I was growing confident and suggested that we take it to the road. S okayed it and we began slowly driving on the road around the buildings. My confidence was soaring by now, and I was growing comfortable with the idea that I could control this behemoth of a machine. I went around the buildings four times. We were on the fag end of the road, where a right hand turn would take us to the road that ran parallel to the football field. I took the right turn, and was bringing the steering wheel back to its normal position. The old Mahindra, like its million cousins was a pain to steer. I had passed the curve and I had not yet managed to steer the jeep back to the straight position. There was a huge cedar tree on the right side about 6 meters away. I was going at 20kmph and thought I still had a lot of time to steer it back. My friend sitting in the back did not think so and shouted out that we were headed for the tree. And then, all hell broke loose. I rammed the accelerator down, thinking it was the brake, and the jeep sped in to the cedar tree. I dont remember how fast it was, but it was pretty fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We survived. I had to shell out around 6k to repair the right side of the jeep. I had managed to spectacularly break the bumper, the suspension and the brake on the right side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This incident left me with an absolute terror of vehicles and the road. When we finally managed to get the jeep repaired, my friends advised me to continue learning. I remember sitting there behind the wheels of the jeep in the football field - hands trembling, head shaking and heart racing. The fear of ending up killing somebody on the road and was real and strong. At that moment, I gave up. I decided that I would never attempt to drive in my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-fascination&#34;&gt;The fascination&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving to Bangalore almost three years ago changed my life in more ways than one. Playing football, the thing around which my days revolved around during college ended up being something I did once in a while. Reaching places where people played football proved to be very difficult. I remember having to hop on two buses to get to IISc. to play a game of football on Sundays and I equally remember a game of football in a ground in JP Nagar being interrupted by one of those ultra-Kannadiga politicians turning up and decreeing that only Kannadigas could play. I did discover this awesome gang that played football everyday at the Koramangala Post Office grounds. I was a regular there for a long time. Walking for 30 minutes at 6:00 AM was proving to be difficult. I really wanted to be able to transport myself to different quarters fast. Bicycle, anyone?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-retry&#34;&gt;The retry&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started trying to learn to ride. My brother, who is 11 years younger than me tried to help me. But then, it never took off. The pain and embarrassment of showing off my noob-ishness on a street where the onlookers were people who slightly admired me was too much. The learning sessions lasted about ten minutes each and ended with me being left totally frustrated with myself. This was not going to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;and-then-it-happened&#34;&gt;And then, it happened&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to IISc on a Saturday two weeks ago. The desire to learn had returned to me. IISc has a big football field, an my friend suggested that I ride around the field. I rode the bike and after the initial struggling to gain balance, it just came to me. I could do this thing. I was doing it. It was far from perfect, but I was comfortable, and I had balance. As I completed my first round around the football field, I felt the kind of happiness that I have seldom felt in my life. I really could do this. Three hours of riding around the ground and 15 minutes on the road that increasingly looked like the road where I had the jeep accident later, I knew that I had cracked it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-road&#34;&gt;The road&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following Friday I borrowed a friend&amp;rsquo;s bicycle. I was vary excited. I kept on telling people that I had to leave early, lest I end up under one of those sad-looking blue &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bmtcinfo.com/site/index.jsp&#34; title=&#34;BMTC&#34;&gt;BMTC&lt;/a&gt; buses. The memory of riding the bicycle on to the road from the parking lot would live with me forever. It was around 5:00pm and that is not the kind of time when a cycling noob would want to ride on Bangalore&amp;rsquo;s roads. I was afraid, and I was not making up the fear about the buses. But I knew that this time no fear of life or failure would hold me back. In that crazy rush-hour traffic, I rode home. And no, I did not end up under a bus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the following day, I practiced for close to four hours. I was getting very comfortable. And on Sunday, I rode close to 20 kilometers, more than half of it on the Bannerghatta road. There was crazy amount of traffic, I was still afraid of the buses. In fact a blue BMTC bus almost knocked me out of the road. But that had more to do with the driver of the bus being a total moron than me making any mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-crash&#34;&gt;The crash&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was returning from this ride full of pride and a more than healthy dose of confidence. I had rode 20 kilometers on some of Bangalore&amp;rsquo;s craziest roads and had done well. As I approached the place I live, I was riding pretty fast. On the penultimate turn, I sped before I had come out of the curve, and I the bicycle and me crashed hard on the tarmac. From the pain and the amount of skidding my body did on the tarmac and the flight of my spectacles, I guessed it would have been spectacular. I had a bunch of keys in my jeans pockets and one of those decided to embed it&amp;rsquo;s end to my thigh. There was a lot of blood. The pair of jeans survived, and so did my knees and elbows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-aftermath&#34;&gt;The aftermath&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I regularly ride the bicycle to the office these days. I still have not mastered it. I am still afraid of the blue BMTC buses. I still get confused when that motherly lady with the small kid decides it is a great idea to step in front of a bicycle. But, what the heck? I will ride the bicycle like I should have 20 years ago - full of pride and joy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Saying Good Bye is tough</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Njaan Varaam, Assalamu Alaikum&lt;/em&gt; (I will be back, Peace Be Upon You). I felt myself choking as those words escaped my mouth. And as I reached the gate and took my first step out, I heard my mother say &lt;em&gt;Wa Alaikum Assalaam&lt;/em&gt; (Peace Be Upon You, too). And then I felt the straps of the laptop bag sink into my shoulders, and it felt so heavy. It should not be. It still had the same stuff as it did when I set on my journey home on the Friday evening. In fact, it should feel lighter, as I had moved some stuff into another bag, which I was holding in my right hand. Sigh! I knew why I choked and the bag felt heavier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had been performing this almost teary-eyed, choking Good Bye scene endless number of times, ever since I was 12. The first, if I remember correctly, was when I set on my journey to be part of the residential school which would end up as my world for the subsequent seven years. I remember being sad, and being happy and excited with anticipation at living at the school. My good bye was not drenched in tears, nor were I choking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The choking and the tears happened when I was about to return to the school after my first trip back home. I had seen the school, experienced it and quickly had realized that it was not what I wanted. But, I went back, and ever since saying Good Bye to my mother at the gate is an experience that makes me deeply emotional. Even these days, when I know that going back home is as easy as jumping onto a bus. But still, somewhere deep inside me, I can still hear that boy telling me &amp;lsquo;Dude, you wont be back till the next vacation, and you know what? The next vacation is in next May. That is five months!&amp;rsquo;. Those of you who know about my school would understand the significance of those words. For others, &lt;a href=&#34;https://sdqali.in/blog/2008/11/12/school-story-the-adult-magazines-and-the-great-raid/&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; would give some idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Post school, I went to college at Trivandrum. During the first year, I used to find silly excuses to come home almost every other weekend. I didn&amp;rsquo;t mind bunking classes, just to go home. And after all these trips, I still lived those moments of choking, all over again. I knew, I could be back here the next day, if I wanted to. I knew I was no longer in a &amp;lsquo;jail&amp;rsquo;. Still, it hurt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These days, when I know that nothing would prevent me from getting back home the next weekend, I still feel that choking. I am too old to cry, but it would be a lie if I said that there were no tears lingering in the depths of my eyes. You see, however silly it might seem,for me, saying Good Bye is a big deal and it hurts.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Missing the game</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have continued to watch and follow the beautiful game, save for my first few months in Bangalore. This is supposed to be a metro. Well, apparently a metro where people don&amp;rsquo;t give a damn about football. After taking a cable connection, I soon realized that I will have to beg with the cable guy to put on ESPNStar so that I could watch EPL. Pretty soon, Hathway had some issues with ESPNStar, which meant there was no way I could watch ESPNStar. On the weekends, I tried to pursue the cable operator to put on NEO Sports, at least I could watch Bundes Liga and Serie A. He would not budge, and I had to endure the interesting argument that &amp;ldquo;NEO Cricket and NEO Sports are the same&amp;rdquo;. It was tough to accept - in the small village of Vadakkethala, where I hail from, I could watch as much football as I wanted. In Malappuram, if you are a cable TV operator and don&amp;rsquo;t put on channels with football on, God save you. So Bangalore&amp;rsquo;s apparent indifference to football was frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have enjoyed playing the game since I was a small kid, and that habit too has taken a hit since I came to Bangalore. The first time I went to play on a weekend, a guy with a Red and Gold shawl draped around his neck came to the ground and ordered everyone who couldn&amp;rsquo;t speak Kannada out of the ground. Since then, I have come to realize and acknowledge the power of the Red and Gold colors in Bangalore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do manage to play the game once in a while, mainly at a ground in JP Nagar. I am planning to soon join fellow Malayalees playing in a ground in Koramangala.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for watching Football, I have bought a Videocon d2h which gives me all the sports channels I want, and all the Malayalam channels the diamond pack offers is an added advantage. No more arguments with the cable TV guy about NEO Sports and NEO Cricket being two channels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope to watch and play a lot of football.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>TWU Graduation</title>
      <link>https://sdqali.in/blog/2009/09/22/twu-graduation/?utm_source=site&amp;utm_medium=feed</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 22 Sep 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://sdqali.in/blog/2009/09/22/twu-graduation/?utm_source=site&amp;utm_medium=feed</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I had predicted, the last week of training was hectic, chaotic and crazy. Although we ended up leaving the whole project simulation in jeopardy, we learned a lot of things, especially how things that work smoothly at one second can go wrong very very wrong the next second.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had decided beforehand that I would volunteer for roles that I want to do in my career, and that at the same time would leave me out of my comfort zone. I played the BA role for two days, and although I made lots of mistakes, I did certain things well. I was appreciated for the e-mails I sent out that day. And I got some nice feedback from the head of training, and I am sure his words will help me in my way forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once BA-ing was out of the way, I was ready for some coding. But it was a learning experience in itself. On the first day of coding, I and pair spent the whole day staring at our monitor wondering why something ridiculously simple did not work the way it was supposed to do. Later in the day, we discovered that it was because somebody had written code that was simply swallowing an exception instead of throwing it up or doing something about it then and there. One feedback that I had got from my Dev trainers had warned me of exactly this sort of a thing happening, and I could see why he was very serious about this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day was luckier for me, as the pair I was part of actually managed to contribute towards completing one functionality. And we were given the t-shirts that we would wear for our graduation from TWU. During the night, I had to spend some time (read the whole night) trying to re-factor the code I had written for my assignment. In the morning, I was too tired, too sleepy and too giddy to wake up and could not attend the project simulation. I turned up in the afternoon, and found all my colleagues having lots of fun, playing dodge-ball. I learned that the project simulation had failed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a graduation ceremony at the office. Receiving the certificate from the MD, wearing our special edition t-shirts and graduation hats was a great experience. I wonder why Kerala University cannot have a graduation ceremony for B.Tech students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_bZ_kjFIgY0w/Srh7h88cjtI/AAAAAAAABQA/uq5OEtmKWkc/s320/DSC06527.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;TWU-14 graduates&#34; title=&#34;TWU-14 graduates&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TWU-14 graduates. I am somewhere in there, even I dont know where I am!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the evening, we had a graduation party at a nice place called &amp;lsquo;Take5&amp;rsquo;. The food was great, and all souls who enjoy alcohol had an even better time. I sat there with my glass of orange juice. While there was party around us in full flow, I had a nice conversation with a co-worker about philosophy and how life is sometimes very unfair. Intellectually stimulating conversation in a not-so-simulating environment! But I had to leave early, as I had to head home and appear at the Regional Passport Office, Malappuram to prove that I was indeed Sadique Ali K M. More about the passport story later!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The university experience was great, and I learned a lot from trainers and co-workers, met lots of interesting people and made friends with some of them.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The past few days have just flown by. I had to learn so much things and did not have much time to do it. Most days, I sleep around 2:00 in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was in college, I had friends who were already working. I used to wonder why sometimes they did not reply to a mail I sent, or did not ping me back when I pinged them on IM. Well, now I know! If any of you are reading this, guys, please pardon me for not understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had an assignment to submit and I got the feedback that the work I had done was &amp;lsquo;Poor&amp;rsquo;. Had a tough time, when I got the response. But having thought about the feedback given to me about the assignment, I now understand that there are a lot of thins I need to learn, there are changes to be made in the way I approach coding, and there are some stuff to be un-learned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope I will be able to cope with the pressure and move forward.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Yet another week in Bangalore</title>
      <link>https://sdqali.in/blog/2009/08/16/yet-another-week-in-bangalore/?utm_source=site&amp;utm_medium=feed</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 16 Aug 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://sdqali.in/blog/2009/08/16/yet-another-week-in-bangalore/?utm_source=site&amp;utm_medium=feed</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yet another week of my Bangalore life has unfolded. It was tougher, and better than the first two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned lots of new stuff, stuff that would greatly help me in my profession. I made friends with new people. But most important of all, I got some feedback on some of the things I do in life. It was kind of very scary, to be honest. But then I realized that the feedback will let me improve. I am trying hard to use the feedback in the most positive way possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally was able to enjoy some football. It was the friendly between Netherlands and England. Since England was playing away, Sony Pix did not care to telecast it. I had to listen to BBC Radio 5 Live on the web. It was kind of nostalgic. It reminded of the Saturday and Sunday evenings, when I would sit and listen to the commentary of English Premier League on BBC World Service. The only place where people watched live football was in the local sports club, and I was not allowed to go there after the evenings. So I would sit and listen to the commentary, broken every five minutes by the latest breaking news, alerts on goals in football matches elsewhere, and tennis and golf updates. I think football commentary on Radio is more descriptive and the commentators (at least the better ones) really manage to give you a mental picture of the distribution of players on the field, and the movement of players. The commentary on Radio 5 Live was good too. May be I am biased; the commentary I used to hear on World Service seems to be better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I watched the first day of English Premier Leagues. Chelsea seems to have transformed under Ancellotti; they passed the ball brilliantly. The only flipside for Chelsea fans would have been the sight of Stephen Hunt celebrating the opening goal. A collision with the former Reading winger two seasons ago left Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech with an injured head and the Czech still wears protective head-gear while playing. The Stamford Bridge faithful let Hunt know they did not like him by booing every instant he touched the ball. But Hunt did manage to score the new season&amp;rsquo;s first goal. Didier Drogba scored two amazing goals –the first was a breathtaking free kick. The second one looked more like an attempted cross and Drogba admitted it in the post match interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arsenal ran riot against Everton, and they won 6-1. It was sad to see some of the Goodison Park faithful booing David Moyes&amp;rsquo;s team. Wigan beat Aston Villa to earn the first surprise result of the season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friends had a get together back at Manjeri. Talked to them while the party was on. Really miss those guys! Wanted to be there.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bangalore Journal</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is my 13th day in Bangalore. And the first week of my training at ToughtWorks has gone by. I learned lots of stuff, talked to some great people and made friends with some of them. I still have not overcome the difficulties of adapting to life in the City. May be I will soon, or I never will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had planned to post everyday about my experiences in TWU. But I did not have much time. The sessions last till 5:00 pm, and then I will be very tired to do much. I am really missing football. I had hoped to play with my friend Aneesh on last Sunday, but we were not allowed to play as one old guy who turned up decided that only regulars could play there. Sigh !!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the positive things have been that my flatmate is an amazing person. He is a leftist, and it seems we share the same view on all kind of issues. We have heated and passionate discussions/debates/arguments about all kind of things under the sun -politics, the economy, religion and technology. The fact that we have the same views on almost all issues allows us to go deep in to the subject and have very intellectually simulating discussions. The discussions continue till late in the night. He is a software engineer of tremendous experience, and I hope I will learn some things from him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the personal front, I have a big decision to make, but I am confused like anything. For the time being, I am going to play the &amp;lsquo;wait-and-watch&amp;rsquo; game. Hope things turn out well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The football season is kicking off tomorrow with the FA Community Shield. Looking forward to watching ManUtd in the new kit, with Rooney playing as the striker. The transfer market has almost died down, with Xabi Alonso&amp;rsquo;s move to Madrid being the last significant transfer. Sunderland is splashing lots of money, Darren Bent being the latest player to be on the payroll at the Stadium of Light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happened to read the incredible story of Wimbledon AFC&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/news/5989930/AFC-Wimbledon-face-Luton-Town-in-Blue-Square-Premier-after-four-promotions.html&#34;&gt;remarkable rise&lt;/a&gt; through the Football pyramid. The fact that thy are playing Luton Town in the season opener is kind of an irony. Wimbledon AFC&amp;rsquo;s rise and Luton Town&amp;rsquo;s fall epitomizes everything the game of football represents - ecstasy and agony; pain and joy; dizzying heights and demoralizing lows. Good luck to AFC Wimledon! They did a tremendous job of rebuilding after their proud club was &amp;lsquo;moved&amp;rsquo; to Milton Keynes and re-branded as MK Dons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During one of heated debates with my friend, he made the point that the issue of Palestine had become one of &amp;lsquo;my ego&amp;rsquo;. I know I am emotional about Palestine, but is it a matter of ego for me? I am not sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next week will see me and my fellow trainees at ThoughtWorks get some hands-on coding training. I am really looking forward to it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ajmal Qasab and his friends should hang their heads in shame</title>
      <link>https://sdqali.in/blog/2009/04/16/ajmal-qasab-and-his-friends-should-hang-their-heads-in-shame/?utm_source=site&amp;utm_medium=feed</link>

      <guid>https://sdqali.in/blog/2009/04/16/ajmal-qasab-and-his-friends-should-hang-their-heads-in-shame/?utm_source=site&amp;utm_medium=feed</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I happened to watch the show &amp;lsquo;The Buck Stops Here&amp;rsquo; presented by Barkha Dutt on NDTV 24 X 7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trial of Ajmal Qasab, the lone terrorist captured during the Nov.27 attack on Mumbai and fellow defendants had begun in Mumbai and the court relieved Anjali Waghmare, the lawyer appointed by the court to defend Qasab, because of what it saw as a conflict of interest. Anjali Waghmare is the wife of a policeman. Qasab asked for a Pakistani lawyer to represent him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main topic for discussion on the show was whether Qasab should be given a Pakistani lawyer to defend him. The panel included Ram Jethmalani-one of India&amp;rsquo;s best lawyers ever, an MP of the Siv Sena, the attorney representing the state of Maharashtra in the case, a visiting journalist from Pakistan and most notably Shantanu Saikia, whose wife Sabina died during the attacks. While there were arguments for and against Qasab being given a Pakistani lawyer, the highest point of the show was when Shantanu Saikia told the surprised panel that he, and his daughter and son had decided to forgive Qasab for what he had done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saikia said that his wife was just a victim, and not the target and that hanging Qasab wont make things any better for him, his children or the world in general. He also added that his 12-year old son has expressed a desire to visit Qasab in jail and spend time with him. Everyone in the panel, and even Barkha Dutt herself was rendered speechless. Shantanu went on to add that we need to expel fears, anger and dogma from our minds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A visibly moved Barkha Dutt, lost for words tried to conclude the discussions, even as Ram Jethmalani interrupted, saying &amp;ldquo;This young man&amp;rsquo;s words must be printed, broadcast and spread throughout the world. When the terrorists see it, they will hang their head in shame !&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Barkha Dutt, having regained her composure concluded the discussions, Shantanu Saikia&amp;rsquo;s words still echoed in my hearts, and I am sure that anybody who happened to watch the show would have felt the same. In these times of anger and hatred, one man has demonstrated that we can still raise above the common theme of hatred, spreading rays of love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shantanu Saikia, hats off to you !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS: I personally think that Qasab should be given the highest punishment possible. It may not change the minds of these terrorists, but it will certainly remind them of the consequences of carrying out attacks against innocent people.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>When I used to love Cricket</title>
      <link>https://sdqali.in/blog/2009/02/26/when-i-used-to-love-cricket/?utm_source=site&amp;utm_medium=feed</link>

      <guid>https://sdqali.in/blog/2009/02/26/when-i-used-to-love-cricket/?utm_source=site&amp;utm_medium=feed</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Taking a tour through the orkut albums of some of my friends from my school, I happened to see a photo of us in the playground, shot after a game of cricket. And there I was - thin, short and most surprisingly for me, with a cricket bat in my hand. True, I have seen the photo a number of times, I had even commented on it, but today, the bat in my hand reminding me solidly that I once used to play cricket and love it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-hWsuR3VWy9I/SabRvGVCWSI/AAAAAAAAAyc/oSjcdEsGsmE/s673/ckt.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;Good-old days: With friends after a game&#34; title=&#34;Good-old days: With friends after a game&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Good-old days: With friends after a game&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, football was the favorite sport, but the students in the school loved playing cricket. One of the prime reasons was that Mr.P, the man in charge of Sports and Physical Education possessed a not so great opinion of Cricket. So he restricted the students from playing Cricket other than on Sundays. On the other hand, playing football was widely promoted - if you just wanted to juggle the ball alone, you could have a ball issued your name, such was the number of balls. There used to be around 10-12 different football matches in progress simultaneously in the playground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr.P&amp;rsquo;s honest comments about cricket included &amp;ldquo;anybody could play cricket, even somebody who was not physically fit&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Cricket as a game cannot contribute to physical well being&amp;rdquo; and quite simply &amp;ldquo;Playing cricket in the ground destroys the window panes !&amp;rdquo;. The third point he made was what made the authorities sanction the restriction on cricket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The restrictions imposed on Cricket was counterproductive. It induced a greater love for the game and Cricket thrived in hostel corridors, places behind the hostels and inside new buildings being built. It was &amp;ldquo;gully&amp;rdquo; cricket and inside the walls, &amp;ldquo;County&amp;rdquo; was what we used to cal it. It was all &amp;ldquo;under-arm&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;hit-a-six-you-are-out&amp;rdquo;,and &amp;ldquo;no-shots-on-the-legside&amp;rdquo;. The bats were made out of planks the construction workers used to support the concrete, and balls were either rubber-balls or made out of socks filled with paper and a small piece of rock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any word about &amp;ldquo;County&amp;rdquo; would be incomplete without a mention of Kandahar. Kandahar was the most famous County venue. Kandahar was the concrete slab of septic tank of the new hostel building under construction and the areas around it. As it was wedged between the compound wall and the building, the occasional tours by teachers near the hostels failed to disrupt the flow of the game at Kandahar. The name Kandahar was coined after the (in)famous hostage drama at Kandahar in Afghanistan involving an Indian flight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was a good County player, I used to love hitting the balls bowled under-arm, as they were always under the knees and cried to be hit. I enjoyed bowling too - both off-spin and leg-spin (When you bowl underarm, it is very easy).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Sundays, when we did have the permission to play cricket in the main ground, all of us couldn&amp;rsquo;t play - you cannot have 10 simultaneous games of cricket in a ground, we managed three or four. The part of the ground that contained the main pitch in the centre was the most valuable piece of earth on Sundays, and we used to go to extremes to ensure that we got it. If you wanted to play in a pitch, you had to &amp;ldquo;book&amp;rdquo; the pitch before everyone else. &amp;ldquo;Booking&amp;rdquo; involved writing stuff like &amp;ldquo;Booked by Shiwalik 11th&amp;rdquo; on the sand. There was an unwritten rule that whoever &amp;ldquo;booked&amp;rdquo; a pitch after 12:00 AM on a Sunday had the right to play there. And bookings went to the wire, invariably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was the one responsible for &amp;ldquo;booking&amp;rdquo; the pitch for my friends from our hostel -Shiwalik. I remember waking up at 3:00 am, and pleading with the house captain for the key to the doors. Gradually, others began to push the boundaries and it became very competitive. There were incidents of a pitch being &amp;ldquo;booked&amp;rdquo; at 12:00 am. Such was the wish to play cricket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in spite of my abilities for booking the centre-pitch, and my prowess in playing &amp;ldquo;County&amp;rdquo;, I was very bad at the real game. My batting was poor, bowling laughable. Fielding was the only thing I could do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we were in 11th standard, cricket inside the walls got a huge boost, as a great gentleman named Subith was appointed our Computer teacher. He joined us for games of cricket on Sundays and since he was very good at playing, everyone enjoyed it. He was great company, too. You could talk your heart out to him, and trust him to not to tell other teachers. We, teenagers inside the walls really needed someone like him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My love for cricket died the day I stepped out of the gates. There I was, free to play any game I wanted, with nobody to tell me not to play a game. And I always had greater love for football than cricket, and so I chose football.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really miss the race to &amp;ldquo;book&amp;rdquo; the pitch, the wooden plank bats and the socks-balls.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, we celebrated the birthday of one of my friends. There was not much of celebration per se, we just went to his place, talked a lot and had food from a restaurant. The restaurant bill was paid by the three guests, and not the host, but that is another story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It had been a long since the four of us had come together, and so we talked about all stuff. My friend,the birthday boy, a student of nursing was apparently neck-deep in politics and was planning an agitation against the State governments decision to scrap Entrance Exams for some of the medical courses. Like every time we had a conversation back in school, our discussions turned a bit philosophical and soon we were arguing about the relevance of birthdays, anniversaries and New Years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have for long thought that there is nothing special about Birthdays, except for the pleasing fact that all near and dear gave you gifts. Another phenomenon I have observed is that friends of mine, who enjoy the company of alcohol, seems to get hold of an invisible license to drink as much as their guts could hold. Sure, I like the idea of pampering yourself on a day, but you can do that on any other day. One could argue that Birthdays signified one more year added onto your life. No arguments there, but then each birthday should also remind you that you have one year less to live. So there is not much joy from that angle, either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have never celebrated my birthday, except one. It was my 17th or 18th, I do not remember exactly. But I certainly remember that it had nothing much to do with my joy on turning 16 ( or 17). It had more to do with a pretty female classmate of mine, and my childish, boyish (I am confused which of those describe it better !) fascination for her, and my apparent eagerness to have her notice me. It was not much of a success, but you will hear about it later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming to New Years, I have never seem much special in January 1. New Year resolutions are one interesting thing about New Years, but we all know, most of them gets broken on January 3rd for the normal ones and January 14th for the more dogged ones. It is easy to think you get a clean slate of life, to start all over again, but after one week or so of writing life on it, you realize that the writings of last year have not been erased completely , and the new scribblings appear as a hazy jumble, in a background of partly erased writings from the past year/years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there is not much about Birthday and New Years that call for a celebration, right ?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tough Love</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am about to finish my college within five months. As almost everyone at this juncture of life would have done, I am already beginning to look back at it. And nothing resurfaces from my memory like that of how it all began.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still remember those days after I had finished school, when I had not decided what I wanted to do. Of course, I wanted to study, but higher education did not look a feasible prospect. There were talks in the family about how costly college education was. And worse still, the discussions were being led by my father&amp;rsquo;s elder brother who was my Godfather, and easily the person whose words the family dared not to questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So one day, I went up to him, and asked &amp;lsquo;So, are you going to tell me that my studies are over?’. That was the only time I had dared to stand up to him, and tell him something in his face. Never had I done that before, and never have I done that after that fateful day, and I doubt if I will ever do that again. He did not answer, and something made me ask him &amp;rsquo; so what was the point of making me rot seven of my formative years in a jail?’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time, I could not realize why I had just asked him that, but later I could see that it was my anger at realizing that I had missed a lot during the seven years I spent inside the walls of my school. But then, I had gained a lot too, but at that time, I wasn’t wise enough to realize it though. My uncle stared back at me, and I realized I was beginning to get intimidated. But I was determined not to back off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then he said- &amp;lsquo; Sadique, do you realize that your family will have to make great many sacrifices to put you through college?&amp;rsquo; I nodded. He asked me another question &amp;lsquo;Are you sure you will be able to successfully complete college, and repay the family for all the sacrifices they will make for you?&amp;rsquo;. This time, I did more than just nod- I said &amp;lsquo;Yes, I am sure!’. He said, without his eyes shifting for even one second &amp;lsquo;Then, Sadique, you will go to college!&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One week later, I had enrolled at the entrance tuition center in town. The decision to take up Engineering was easier than I had imagined it would be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The center was just four kilometers from home, and soon I began to discover stuff I missed while I was at my school. Like bunking classes and wandering around the town and the paddy fields of Kottakkal. Like spending time idly chatting away at the eatery near the institute, like watching the cricket match hiding away inside the shop the local video lending shop. I never was a cricket fan, and yet, I never missed an opportunity to watch a match inside Ramsee&amp;rsquo;s video store. I watched in awe as Ramsee and his friends made comments at the girls of the institute. For them, it was pretty natural, but for me, it was a whole new world, one of freedom that I had never experienced before. Back in my jail, such offenses would have been dealt with the mandatory iron fist, and they used to call it tough love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I never forgot the promise I made to my uncle. Many a cricket matches at Ramsee&amp;rsquo;s, lots of teas and cream buns at the bakery, and nights of studies later, I was at CET. Looking back, the strongest image I see is that of my uncle. May be his way is what they should call tough love.&lt;/p&gt;
