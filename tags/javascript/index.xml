      <description>Making a map that shows a disputed territory can be a tricky business. Nation states vigorously contest maps that appear to portray a boundary that challenges what a border looks like. From the Falkland Islands to Kuril Islands; from Western Sahara to Arunachal Pradesh, disputed territories result in omissions, additions and inaccuracies in maps.
I grew up looking at maps in books printed by the Oxford Press, that came with a disclaimer in blue rubber stamped across them that stated how the map was wrong.</description>

      <title>A list of GIS tools</title>

      <description>I have been playing around with maps a lot these days and have ended up using various tools in the process. This blog post is a way to make a note of these tools for later use.
geojson.io Mapbox&amp;rsquo;s geojson.io is a simple tool for creating, editing and sharing maps. It lets you import map data in various formats and has an editor to modify maps.
GeoJSON-TopoJSON Jeff Paine&amp;rsquo;s GeoJSON-TopoJSON is a simple tool to convert between the more common GeoJSON format and the TopoJSON format used by libraries like D3.</description>

      <title>Fitting an Image in to a Canvas object</title>

      <description>I have been playing around with Canvas objects and images for a side project I am doing. One of the first things I had to figure out for this project was how to fit an image of arbitrary height and width on to a Canvas object of arbitrary, but known dimensions while preserving the aspect ratios of the image. This blog post is an explanation of the solution I came up with for this.</description>

      <title>Named Capture Groups in Regular Expressions</title>
      <link>https://sdqali.in/blog/2013/09/29/named-capture-groups-in-regular-expressions/</link>

      <description>I will admit that I find regular expressions somewhat hard to parse. While the thinking process needed to write a regular expression is iterative and hence results in the correct expression suitable for the situation, once it is written it lacks readability. I have faced that pain of trying to grok a complex regular expression written years ago. So I was pleasantly surprised when I saw this example from Hacker News user WestCoastJustin.</description>

      <title>JavaScript, clipboard access and hidden flash widgets</title>

      <description>Letting users copy text and URLs from a webpage effortlessly is one of those things that sound easy in theory, but is a pain when it comes to implementation. Browsers take great efforts to ensure that web pages are sand boxed in such a way that a web application can not read from or write to the system&amp;rsquo;s clipboard without jumping through hoops. Firefox asks you to change browser configurations to give web applications access to the system clipboard, while Internet Explorer shows a modal dialog to confirm that you really want to allow the application access.</description>

      <title>My first Firefox plugin: GetCache - View cached version of the current page</title>
      <link>https://sdqali.in/blog/2012/11/29/my-first-firefox-plugin-getcache---view-cached-version-of-the-current-page/</link>

      <guid>https://sdqali.in/blog/2012/11/29/my-first-firefox-plugin-getcache---view-cached-version-of-the-current-page/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I released my &lt;a href=&#34;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/getcache-ff/&#34;&gt;first Firefox plugin&lt;/a&gt; today. It
is awaiting review, but if you are adventurous, you can install it right
now. Go on, try it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I had written the &lt;a href=&#34;https://sdqali.in/blog/2012/11/28/getcache-a-chrome-plugin-to-view-cached-version-of-the-current-page/&#34;&gt;Chrome version&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ManishChaks&#34;&gt;Manish&lt;/a&gt; suggested
that I should write one for Firefox. There already exist Firfox plugins
that does exactly what GetCache does, but I decided to go ahead and write it
for fun. And of course, the fact that I could publish it without having
to sign up with my Credit Card information was enticing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>GetCache - A Chrome plugin to view cached version of the current page</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download the plugin
&lt;a href=&#34;https://sdqali.in/downloads/GetCache.crx&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On numerous occasions, I have ran in to the situation where I had to
look up how to load Google&amp;rsquo;s cached version of a particular page. This
happens often when I follow a link from Hacker News or Reddit to a blog
post and the blog has went down due to the great avalanche of traffic
from HN and Reddit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After struggling to remember and having to Google how to get the cached
version, I decided to finally solve this issue. I wrote &lt;code&gt;GetCache&lt;/code&gt;, a
dead simple Google Chrome plugin that loads Google&amp;rsquo;s cached version of
the current page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;installing&#34;&gt;Installing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can download the plugin
&lt;a href=&#34;https://sdqali.in/downloads/GetCache.crx&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. In order to install it, open your
Extensions page (&lt;code&gt;Window -&amp;gt; Extensions&lt;/code&gt;) and drag the downloaded &lt;code&gt;CRX&lt;/code&gt;
file to the page.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How Browsers Detect If You Are Offline</title>

      <description>When I saw the newly released Heyoffline.js library, I was curious to see how it figured out if the user was online or not. This led me to the window.navigator.onLine API and how different browsers implement it. Chrome, Safari and Inernet Explorer 10 make sure that the API detects if the user is connected to a network, while Firefox changes this flag if and only if the user chooses the Work Offline option.</description>

      <title>XConf 6 - Data, My Heart!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last Saturday,  Srijayanth Sridhar (&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/craftybones&#34;&gt;@craftybones&lt;/a&gt;) and I gave a talk at XConf, ThoughtWorks India&amp;rsquo;s internal conference series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We talked about visualising data, and the various visualisations that one could use to answer questions about the dataset you have. We looked at two particular datasets -  one showing the consumption of juice at the fresh juice counter in office and one about Indian and Pakistani players. We looked at various visualizations like Area charts, Box Plots, Chord Diagrams, Line Charts, Pie Charts, Donut Charts, Small Multiples, Spark Lines, Stack Charts and Treemaps.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Indian and Pakistani cricketers - who make better debuts?</title>
      <link>https://sdqali.in/blog/2012/05/11/indian-and-pakistani-cricketers---who-make-better-debuts/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently a friend and I had an argument about who makes better debuts among Indian and Pakistani cricket players. Now, I am not into cricket. But I do watch the odd matches here and there and am generally aware of what is going on in the game. My stand was that Pakistani players make better debuts compared to Indian players, while my friend was adamant that Indian players make better debuts. My friend is more of a cricket guy than I ever was and he asked me what is the basis of my stand. It was just a gut feel for me and I had to leave it as there was no way for me to prove that my gut feel was correct. But I did want to try, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to see if I could prove my theory. Luckily, Cricinfo has all this data, although they dont make it easy for you to get it. I wrote some scripts to pull this data and decided to visualise this using the awesome d3 library. In the end, this became more about figuring out d3 than winning the argument, but doing this was fun.&lt;/p&gt;
