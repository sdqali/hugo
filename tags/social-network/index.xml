      <title>Dear Content Creator, Your URL Shortener Is Pointless</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;People love URL shorteners. They are everywhere. You can use one of
&lt;a href=&#34;http://goo.gl&#34;&gt;the giants&lt;/a&gt;, or use one of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://bit.ly&#34;&gt;URL Shortening As A Service&lt;/a&gt; options available
or you can run one on your own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But none of that matters. Apart from adding to the redirect hell
prevalent on the web today and giving you a minor branding push, custom
URL shorteners does not add anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People started using these shortening services because of two
reasons. The first reason was the necessity to share
ugly URLs like
&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://example.com/reports.php?start=2001&amp;amp;end=2010&amp;amp;item=Foo%20bar&#34;&gt;http://example.com/reports.php?start=2001&amp;amp;end=2010&amp;amp;item=Foo%20bar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and
they wanted to make it easier on the eyes of people. The second reason
was the limit on the number of characters allowed in a post by micro blogging services
like Twitter and Identi.ca.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why I am not on Facebook</title>
      <link>https://sdqali.in/blog/2012/08/11/why-i-am-not-on-facebook/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday a colleague of mine asked me if I was on Facebook. He
was genuinely surprised by my reply that I was not and he wanted to know
 why. For the next 20 minutes or so, I explained to him why I quit
 Facebook and does not want anything to do with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not the first time I have had to explain my absence from Facebook. In this post I will explain my attitude towards Facebook in a more structured manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Broadly, these are the points I will touch upon:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Narcissism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Symmetric nature of sharing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The social pressure to &amp;lsquo;friend&amp;rsquo; someone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low signal to noise ratio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <title>Social Networks and their URL Shorteners</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been noticing lately that much of the traffic that my blog
receives comes from Twitter&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;t.co&lt;/strong&gt; domain or Google+&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;strong&gt;plus.url.google.com&lt;/strong&gt; domain. I don&amp;rsquo;t receive much traffic and I don&amp;rsquo;t
particularly care about the amount of traffic. However, when I
see traffic from Google+ or Twitter, I know that somebody is discussing
or sharing my posts and I am curious to know who is doing that. But if I
look at where the traffic comes from, with the hope that I will be able
to find Tweets or Google+ updates where people are talking about my
content, all I would be able to see is a &lt;strong&gt;t.co&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;plus.url.google.com&lt;/strong&gt;
URL that redirects to my page. While it is mildly frustrating, I have
been thinking why both Twitter and Google+ replace every URL users share
on their network and replace it with their own URLs that does a redirect
to the original content being shared.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
