              <p>If you have an application that writes logs, there are many reasons to make it write the log in JSON format. It makes it easier to search and analyze them when using tools such as the ELK Stack [^1]. JSON formatted logs make it easier to look at them when looking at how the app is behaving in real time using tools like jq [^2]. This blog post documents how to format logs as JSON in a Spring application.</p>

              <p>This is one of those blog posts about things I wish I had known before I spent a lot of time figuring out when something was not working as expected. Recently, we have been trying to extend a <code>WebMvcConfigurerAdapter</code> to wire up an HTTP request interceptor. And things did not work as we expected it to and we learned that our understanding of how Spring behaved under this situation was wrong. This is a write up to refer back to if and when we encounter this issue again.</p>

              <p>Yesterday my colleague <a href="https://twitter.com/imdhmd">Imdad</a> asked if there was a mechanism to add filtering to a Spring MVC end point that responded with JSON.

              <p>Two weeks ago, I was in the Scottish Highlands - soaking in the beauty of the city of Inverness, hiking through the South Loch Ness trail and traveling across the Black Isle. It was a wonderful trip - one that I wish was longer. This was a trip that invoked so many memories in me - among other things, of a man whose voice was part of growing up. A voice that traveled from the BBC Studios in the United Kingdom halfway across the globe and into a radio set in South Malabar.</p>

            <p class="post-subtitle">
              <p>Recently at work, we had to deprecate a domain event. This event used to represent an error scenario. However, the business had since decided that this is no longer a valid error scenario. Removing the Java class is not straight forward - since there are events of this type stored in the event store, every time the aggregate associated with this event is loaded, Axon will throw errors trying to de-serialize them.</p>

              <p>In the last <a href="/blog/2016/04/17/programmable-exit-codes-for-spring-command-line-applications/">blog post</a>, we took a look at how to implement programmable exit codes for spring command line applications by using exceptions that implement <code>ExitCodeGenerator</code>. This time, we will take a look at how to achieve the same without having to depend on an exception.</p>

            <p class="post-subtitle">
              <p>Spring&rsquo;s <code>CommandLineRunner</code> provides a great mechanism to build command line applications. While this convenience is great, applications that use <code>CommandLineRunner</code> require extra effort in some areas like integration testing. Exit codes are such an area - applications that use command line runners always report their exit code as <code>0</code> even if there are exceptions thrown. This blog post explains a way to get to programmable exit codes for such applications.</p>

                Using custom arguments in Spring MVC controllers

            </a>
            <p class="post-subtitle">
              <p>Most of the Spring controllers in the real world accept a lot of different types of parameters - Path variables, URL parameters, request headers, request body and sometimes even the entire HTTP Request object. This provides a flexible mechanism to create APIs. Spring is really good at parsing these parameters in to Java types as long as there is an ObjectMapper (like Jackson) configured to take care of the de-serialization.</p>

<p>However, there are situations where you want methods to receive a parameter of a particular type that has to resolved from a set of parameters–for example, an API can expect consumers to send meta data about a request in the form of headers and need a custom type to hold this information. Spring provides a convenient way to provide such custom arguments. This blog post explores this feature and how to implement it and test it.</p>

            <p class="post-subtitle">
              <p>My team at work has been lately working on a data transformer that pushes information from an external system in to platform. For historical reasons the information is passed to us in the form of flat files. We have been working on a data transformer that reads information from the file and posts it into an HTTP end point.
Apache Camel [^1] makes a natural choice as the base for implementing such a data transformer. The presence of ready to use components that can read files and post information to HTTP end points and the availability of a nice D.S.L. [^2] makes implementation easy and straightforward. One of the things we had to spend time figuring out was how to ensure that we authenticate correctly against our target HTTP end point. This blog post takes a look at various methods we explored.</p>
