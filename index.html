          <p>Users of Dropwizard Metrics will be familiar with <code>ScheduledReporter</code>  - it is a nice pattern that allows metrics reporting to be off loaded to a different thread which periodically sends out the collected metrics instead of making a network call every time a metric is collected. In most use cases, this works great - especially if you are running a server.</p>

          <p>If you have built background workers or other non-server applications with Dropwizard, chances are that you used the Dropwizard Command pattern. In fact, even the sever you wrote with Dropwizard executes a command - specifically <code>io.dropwizard.cli.ServerCommand</code>. While the server command is great, sometimes you want to build applications that have all the goodies that Dropwizard offers, but you dont want to start a server. Managing Lifecycles is one example of a Dropwizard feature that works great for server applications, but needs some tweaking to get working for non-server commands.</p>

          <p>In this blog post, we will explore how Postgres stores Enum types and how to query for Enum types and their values. Postgres&rsquo; Enum, like their counterparts in many programming languags are data types that allow only a predefined set of values to be assigned to them. An interesting difference is that compared to programming languages, Postgres does allow blanks within the values of Enums.</p>

          <p>This blog post is an exercise in identifying all the <code>sequences</code> in a PostgreSQL database that is associated with a table column via an <code>OWNED BY</code> relationship. Figuring out how to do this was harder than it should have been and this journals my understanding of it.</p>

              Understanding trailing @ processing in SAS input

          One of the first things I noticed when I started poking around in SAS code is that the input statement is very powerful, flexible and hence sometimes hard to understand. It can read pretty much anything in to a dataset as long as you tell it what to do.
The use of trailing @s to take control of how SAS advances the input pointer is a powerful technique to read from input files where the data is laid out in non-standard formats.

          I have been playing around with SAS for the last two weeks. I started with a SAS University Edition running on a VirtualBox instance on my MacBook, but soon realized that it was way more convenient to use a SAS OnDemand account. Having made the switch, I realized that all learning materials made references to and used examples with datsets from a library named SASUSER.
It was not clear how to get these datasets and use them in SAS Studio.

          I had the opportunity to give a talk at GraphQL Summit 2018 about the experience of introducing GraphQL for our Payments API at Braintree. It was well received, as far as I could tell - I received a lot of nice feedback and had great conversations with members of the community.
The slides are available here on SpeakerDeck. I will update this post with links to the video of my talk when it becomes available The video of the talk is available here.

          <p>My work uses <a href="http://freebuilder.inferred.org/">FreeBuilder</a> extensively to generate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern">Builder</a> pattern for Java classes. In addition to this, we use the generated Builder classes to deserialize the data calsses using Jackson. After a while it became tiresome to type <code>@FreeBuilder</code> and <code>class Builder extends ...</code> everywhere. So I decided to write and IntelliJ IDEA plugin that does it for me.</p>

          <p>Polyglot was the second gRPC client that I looked at. One of the things that I liked about it is the fact that it does not need users to generate <code>protoset</code> files. It generates the protoset files in flight every time it runs. This, combined with the fact that it is written in Java does have a disadvantage - every time the client makes a call, it has to fire up a JVM, generate protosets and make the request.</p>
