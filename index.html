            <p class="post-subtitle">
              <p>Recently at work, we had to deprecate a domain event. This event used to represent an error scenario. However, the business had since decided that this is no longer a valid error scenario. Removing the Java class is not straight forward - since there are events of this type stored in the event store, every time the aggregate associated with this event is loaded, Axon will throw errors trying to de-serialize them.</p>

              <p>In the last <a href="/blog/2016/04/17/programmable-exit-codes-for-spring-command-line-applications/">blog post</a>, we took a look at how to implement programmable exit codes for spring command line applications by using exceptions that implement <code>ExitCodeGenerator</code>. This time, we will take a look at how to achieve the same without having to depend on an exception.</p>

            <p class="post-subtitle">
              <p>Spring&rsquo;s <code>CommandLineRunner</code> provides a great mechanism to build command line applications. While this convenience is great, applications that use <code>CommandLineRunner</code> require extra effort in some areas like integration testing. Exit codes are such an area - applications that use command line runners always report their exit code as <code>0</code> even if there are exceptions thrown. This blog post explains a way to get to programmable exit codes for such applications.</p>

                Using custom arguments in Spring MVC controllers

            <p class="post-subtitle">
              <p>Most of the Spring controllers in the real world accept a lot of different types of parameters - Path variables, URL parameters, request headers, request body and sometimes even the entire HTTP Request object. This provides a flexible mechanism to create APIs. Spring is really good at parsing these parameters in to Java types as long as there is an ObjectMapper (like Jackson) configured to take care of the de-serialization.</p>

<p>However, there are situations where you want methods to receive a parameter of a particular type that has to resolved from a set of parametersâ€“for example, an API can expect consumers to send meta data about a request in the form of headers and need a custom type to hold this information. Spring provides a convenient way to provide such custom arguments. This blog post explores this feature and how to implement it and test it.</p>

              <p>My team at work has been lately working on a data transformer that pushes information from an external system in to platform. For historical reasons the information is passed to us in the form of flat files. We have been working on a data transformer that reads information from the file and posts it into an HTTP end point.
Apache Camel [^1] makes a natural choice as the base for implementing such a data transformer. The presence of ready to use components that can read files and post information to HTTP end points and the availability of a nice D.S.L. [^2] makes implementation easy and straightforward. One of the things we had to spend time figuring out was how to ensure that we authenticate correctly against our target HTTP end point. This blog post takes a look at various methods we explored.</p>

              <p>The Open Graph protocol was designed by Facebook to help content creators generate a richer preview of links to their content when they get posted in to Facebook. It was originally proposed as a simple mark up that can be adopted in platforms beyond Facebook. The Open Graph Protocol Design Decisions presentation [^1] does a very good job of enumerating the motivation and design decisions made for Open Graph. I have lately been reading and experimenting with these tags and I notice a fair bit of differences when it comes to how these tags are used by different platforms.</p>

              <p>In the <a href="/blog/2015/12/10/integration-testing-challenges-for-non-web-spring-applications/">last blog post</a>, I wrote about the challenges of writing an integration test for a Spring command line application. One of the solutions for this issue discussed in the blog post was to use the <code>@IntegrationTest</code> annotations to inject Java system properties and use that to run the application instead of the normal command line arguments. This blog post describes how to perform this.</p>

              When I first started programming, it was predominantly creating applications that utilized the C++ graphics library. I was 14 and my friends and I tried to make the most of the time we got to spend at the computer lab of the boarding school we attended. We created applications that drew pretty, often animated pictures on the screen and not much else. This taught us basics, but our learning lacked any kind of structure.

              <p>I often have to work with Spring MVC based code bases that have been living for a while. One of the common trait of these code bases I have observed is the repeated use of the same Spring annotations to achieve the same effect again and again. A really good example of this is annotating a controller method with a combination of <code>@RequestMapping</code> and <code>@ResponseStatus</code> to set the expected request and response <code>Content-Type</code>, the request Method, response status etc. This blog post describes how to compose Spring annotations that produce the same effect as multiple Spring annotations acting together.</p>
